These signals in a loan account should immediately put the bank on alert regarding a weakness or wrong doing which may ultimately turn out to be fraudulent. A bank cannot afford to ignore such EWS but must instead use them as a trigger to launch a detailed investigation into a RFA. \u003cbr\u003e An illustrative list of some EWS is given for the guidance. Bank may choose to adopt or adapt the relevant signals from this list and also include other alerts/signals based on their experience, client profile and business models. The EWS indicators identified for monitoring credit facilities and other banking transactions shall be approved by the RMCB. The threshold for EWS and RFA is account wise Rs 20 lakh or more (in case of Cash credit sanction limit and for Term loan current outstanding) at the level of a bank irrespective of the lending arrangement (whether solo banking, multiple banking or consortium). The modalities for monitoring of loan below Rs 20.00 lakh threshold is left to the discretion of Credit Monitoring Department. However, bank may continue to report all identified accounts to CFMC, NABARD as per the existing cutâ€offs. \u003cbr\u003e The tracking of EWS in loan accounts should not be seen as an additional task but must be integrated with the credit monitoring process in the bank so that it becomes a continuous activity and also acts as a trigger for any possible credit impairment in the loan accounts, given the interplay between credit risks and fraud risks. In respect of large accounts it is necessary that bank undertake a detailed study of the Annual Report as a whole and not merely of the financial statements, noting particularly the Board Report and the Managementsâ€™ Discussion and Analysis Statement as also the details of related party transactions in the notes to accounts. \u003cbr\u003e The Credit Monitoring department should report the details of loan accounts of Rs 20.00 lakh and above in which EWS are observed, together with the decision to classify them as RFAs or otherwise \u003cbr\u003e to the Chairman of the bank every month. \u003cbr\u003e Early Warning SignalsEarly Warning Signals \u003cbr\u003e Early Warning Signals \u003cbr\u003e Early Warning Signals \u003cbr\u003e Some Early Warning signals which should alert the bank officials about some wrong doings in the loan accounts which may turn out to be fraudulent: \u003cbr\u003e Default in payment to the banks / sundry debtors and other statutory bodies, etc., bouncing of the high value cheques \u003cbr\u003e Under insured or over insured inventory \u003cbr\u003e Invoices devoid of TAN and other details \u003cbr\u003e Dispute on title of the collateral securities \u003cbr\u003e Funds coming from other banks to liquidate the outstanding loan amount \u003cbr\u003e Request received from the borrower to postpone the inspection of the godown for flimsy reasons \u003cbr\u003e Financing the unit far away from the branch \u003cbr\u003e Frequent invocation of BGs and devolvement of LCs \u003cbr\u003e Funding of the interest by sanctioning additional facilities \u003cbr\u003e Same collateral charged to a number of lenders. \u003cbr\u003e Concealment of certain vital documents like master agreement, insurance coverage. \u003cbr\u003e Large number of transactions with interâ€connected companies and large outstanding from such \u003cbr\u003e companies. \u003cbr\u003e Significant movements in inventory, disproportionately higher than the growth in turnover. \u003cbr\u003e Significant movements in receivables, disproportionately higher than the growth in turnover and I or increase in ageing of the receivables. \u003cbr\u003e Disproportionate increase in other current assets. \u003cbr\u003e Significant increase in working capital borrowing as percentage of turnover. \u003cbr\u003e Critical issues highlighted in the stock audit report. \u003cbr\u003e Increase in Fixed Assets, without corresponding increase in turnover (when project is implemented). \u003cbr\u003e Increase in borrowings, despite huge cash and cash equivalents in the borrower\u0027s balance sheet. \u003cbr\u003e Substantial related party transactions. \u003cbr\u003e Poor disclosure of materially adverse information and no qualification by the statutory auditors. \u003cbr\u003e Frequent change in accounting period and I or accounting policies. \u003cbr\u003e Frequent request for general purpose loans. \u003cbr\u003e Movement of an account from one bank to another. \u003cbr\u003e Frequent ad hoc sanctions. \u003cbr\u003e Nonâ€ routing of sales proceeds through bank \u003cbr\u003e LCs issued for local trade I related party transactions \u003cbr\u003e High value RTGS payment to unrelated parties. \u003cbr\u003e Heavy cash withdrawal in loan accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Non submission of original bills. \u003cbr\u003e Reporting of Frauds to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) \u003cbr\u003e In dealing with cases such as unauthorized credit facilities extended by the bank illegal gratification, negligence, cash shortage and embezzlement, bank should not merely be motivated by the necessity of recovering expeditiously the amount involved, but should also be motivated by public interest and the need for ensuring that the guilty persons do not go unpunished. \u003cbr\u003e Therefore, Banks shall immediately report the incidents of fraud to LEAs, subject to applicable laws, as indicated below: \u003cbr\u003e S.

The recovery procedure shall not compromise on the control environment at the recovery location. \u003cbr\u003e Disaster Recovery Plan \u003cbr\u003e Disaster recovery is the process, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of technology infrastructure critical to an organization after a natural or human- induced disaster. Disaster recovery is a subset of BCP. \u003cbr\u003e Backup Site and Implementing DR Solution \u003cbr\u003e Backup site: Backup site is a location where an organisation can easily relocate following a disaster, such as fire, flood, terrorist threat or other disruptive event. This is an integral part of the disaster recovery plan and wider BCP of an organisation. \u003cbr\u003e Types of backup sites \u003cbr\u003e Hot Sites: A hot site is a duplicate of the original site of the bank, with full computer systems as well as near-complete backups of user data. Real-time synchronization between the two sites may be used to mirror the data environment of the original site, using wide area network links and specialized software. \u003cbr\u003e Cold Sites: A cold site is the most inexpensive type of backup site for a bank to operate. It does not include backed up copies of data and information from the original location of the bank, nor does it include hardware already set up. \u003cbr\u003e Warm Sites: A warm site is a compromise between hot and cold. These sites have hardware and connectivity already established, though on a smaller scale than the original production site or even a hot site. Warm sites have backups on hand, but they may not be complete and may be between several days and a week old.

At its core, marketing must be understood as the art and science of identifying, understanding, and fulfilling customer needs. \u003cbr\u003e It can be defined as the process by which companies create value for customers, nurture strong and lasting relationships, and, in return, capture value that drives business growth. In essence, marketing is not just about selling products or servicesâ€”it is about building trust, delivering meaningful experiences, and ensuring mutual benefit for both the company and the customer. \u003cbr\u003e There are five alternative concepts that companies/Firms use to carry out their marketing strategy. \u003cbr\u003e Production Concept â€“ The belief that consumers prefer products that are widely available and affordable. Hence, organizations should focus on improving production efficiency and distribution systems. \u003cbr\u003e Product Concept â€“ The idea that consumers favor products with superior quality, performance, and features. Therefore, organizations should concentrate on continuous product improvement. \u003cbr\u003e Selling Concept â€“ The assumption that consumers will not buy enough of a firmâ€™s products unless the \u003cbr\u003e company undertakes aggressive selling and promotional efforts. \u003cbr\u003e Marketing Concept â€“ The principle that organizational goals are best achieved by understanding the needs and wants of target markets and delivering satisfaction more effectively than competitors. This represents an â€œoutside-inâ€ approach, starting with the customer rather than the product. \u003cbr\u003e Societal Marketing Concept â€“ The perspective that marketing decisions should balance consumer wants, company requirements, and the long-term well-being of both consumers and society. Companies should deliver value in a responsible, sustainable manner. \u003cbr\u003e Marketing Strategy and the Marketing Mix \u003cbr\u003e A marketing strategy defines which customers a company will serve and how it will create value for them. To implement this, marketers develop an integrated marketing plan, which is executed through the marketing mixâ€”the four Ps: product, price, place, and promotion. \u003cbr\u003e Building Customer Relationships \u003cbr\u003e All elements of marketing strategy ultimately aim to build profitable customer relationships. \u003cbr\u003e Customer Relationship Management (CRM): The overall process of creating and maintaining strong, profitable relationships by delivering superior value and satisfaction. \u003cbr\u003e Customer-Perceived Value: A customerâ€™s assessment of the benefits versus costs of a marketing offer, \u003cbr\u003e compared with competing offers. \u003cbr\u003e Customer Satisfaction: The extent to which a productâ€™s perceived performance matches or exceeds buyer \u003cbr\u003e expectations. \u003cbr\u003e Customer Delight: Achieved by going beyond promises and delivering more than expected. \u003cbr\u003e Customer Lifetime Value and Equity \u003cbr\u003e Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The total value of all purchases a customer is expected to make throughout their relationship with the company. Firms aim to maximize CLV by ensuring customers return repeatedly. \u003cbr\u003e Share of Customer: The portion of a customerâ€™s total spending in a product category that goes to a particular company. \u003cbr\u003e Customer Equity: The total combined lifetime values of all customersâ€”a measure of the long-term value \u003cbr\u003e of the companyâ€™s customer base. \u003cbr\u003e Building the Right Customer Relationships Not all customers are equally valuable. Companies must focus on building the right relationships with the right customers, based on two key factors: profitability and loyalty (long-term orientation). When \u003cbr\u003e plotted on two axes, this creates a four-part matrix: \u003cbr\u003e Butterflies â€“ Customers who are profitable but not loyal. They offer high profit potential in the short term, so firms should enjoy transactions while they last, without over-investing in retention. \u003cbr\u003e True Friends â€“ Customers who are both profitable and loyal. These are the most valuable relationships. Companies should invest heavily in nurturing, retaining, and growing these customers. \u003cbr\u003e Barnacles â€“ Customers who are loyal but unprofitable. If the company cannot increase their profitability, it should minimize investment and, if necessary, phase them out. \u003cbr\u003e Strangers â€“ Customers who are neither profitable nor loyal. Firms should not invest in them, as they do not contribute to long-term success. \u003cbr\u003e Strategic Planning Strategic planning is the process of developing and maintaining a strategic fit between an organizationâ€™s goals, capabilities, and changing market opportunities. It forms the foundation for the firmâ€™s long-term \u003cbr\u003e direction and success. \u003cbr\u003e Defining the Mission At the corporate level, strategic planning begins with defining the companyâ€™s missionâ€”a statement of its purpose and overall intent. The mission provides direction and leads to a hierarchy of goals that guide all \u003cbr\u003e levels of the organization. \u003cbr\u003e Business Portfolio Planning The next step is designing the business portfolioâ€”the collection of businesses and products that make up the company. \u003cbr\u003e Portfolio Analysis: The process of evaluating the companyâ€™s businesses and products to allocate resources \u003cbr\u003e effectively. \u003cbr\u003e Strategic Business Units (SBUs): Distinct units within the company, evaluated individually for strategic planning. \u003cbr\u003e BCG Growth-Share Matrix \u003cbr\u003e The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) model classifies SBUs into four categories: \u003cbr\u003e Stars: High-growth, high-market-share units; require heavy investment to sustain growth. \u003cbr\u003e Cash Cows: Low-growth, high-market-share units; generate strong cash flow with minimal investment. \u003cbr\u003e Question Marks: High-growth, low-market-share units; require significant resources but may not always be profitable. \u003cbr\u003e Dogs: Low-growth, low-market-share units; often drain resources and offer limited prospects. \u003cbr\u003e Once classified, companies must decide whether to build, hold, harvest, or divest each SBU. \u003cbr\u003e Growth Strategies: Product/Market Expansion Grid \u003cbr\u003e To plan for the future, firms can use Ansoffâ€™s Product/Market Expansion Grid to identify growth opportunities: \u003cbr\u003e Market Penetration: Increasing sales of current products in existing markets. \u003cbr\u003e Market Development: Entering new markets with existing products. \u003cbr\u003e Product Development: Introducing new or improved products to existing markets. \u003cbr\u003e Diversification: Expanding into entirely new products and markets. \u003cbr\u003e Downsizing \u003cbr\u003e Sometimes, companies must downsize by eliminating unprofitable products, markets, or business units that no longer fit their overall strategy. Downsizing ensures resources are focused on areas with the highest long-term potential. \u003cbr\u003e Marketing Strategy \u003cbr\u003e A marketing strategy is the logic by which a company creates customer value and builds profitable customer relationships. It involves deciding which customers to serve and how to serve them, through four key steps: \u003cbr\u003e Market Segmentation â€“ Dividing the market into distinct groups of buyers with different needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require unique products or marketing approaches. A market segment is a group of consumers who respond similarly to a marketing effort. \u003cbr\u003e Market Targeting â€“ Evaluating the attractiveness of each segment and selecting one or more to serve. \u003cbr\u003e Positioning â€“ Creating a clear, distinctive, and desirable place for the product in the minds of target consumers relative to competitors. \u003cbr\u003e Differentiation â€“ Designing actual differences in the market offering to deliver superior customer value. \u003cbr\u003e The Marketing Mix (4 Ps) \u003cbr\u003e Product â€“ The combination of goods and services the company offers. \u003cbr\u003e Price â€“ The amount customers must pay to obtain the product. \u003cbr\u003e Place â€“ The availability and distribution of the product. \u003cbr\u003e Promotion â€“ Activities that communicate the productâ€™s value and persuade customers to buy. \u003cbr\u003e Marketing Research \u003cbr\u003e Marketing research is the systematic design, collection, analysis, and reporting of data relevant to a specific marketing situation. The process includes four steps: \u003cbr\u003e Defining the Problem and Research Objectives \u003cbr\u003e Exploratory research â€“ Gathers preliminary information to define problems and suggest hypotheses. \u003cbr\u003e Descriptive research â€“ Describes marketing problems, situations, or markets. \u003cbr\u003e Causal research â€“ Tests hypotheses about cause-and-effect relationships. \u003cbr\u003e Developing the Research Plan \u003cbr\u003e Secondary data â€“ Information already collected for another purpose (e.g., online databases, internet sources). Must be relevant, accurate, current, and impartial. \u003cbr\u003e Primary data â€“ Information collected specifically for the study. \u003cbr\u003e Observational research â€“ Collecting data by observing people, actions, or situations. \u003cbr\u003e Ethnographic research â€“ Observing and interacting with consumers in their natural environments. \u003cbr\u003e Survey research â€“ Asking people questions about their knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and behavior. \u003cbr\u003e Experimental research â€“ Testing cause-and-effect by giving different treatments to matched groups and analyzing responses. \u003cbr\u003e Implementing the Research Plan â€“ Collecting, processing, and analyzing data. \u003cbr\u003e Interpreting and Reporting Findings â€“ Both researchers and managers must interpret results to guide decisions. \u003cbr\u003e Consumer Buying Behavior \u003cbr\u003e Consumers display different types of buying decision behavior depending on their level of involvement and the degree of brand differences perceived: \u003cbr\u003e Complex Buying Behavior â€“ High involvement + significant brand differences. Consumers engage in learning, forming beliefs and attitudes before purchase. \u003cbr\u003e Dissonance-Reducing Buying Behavior â€“ High involvement + few brand differences. Consumers may purchase quickly but experience post-purchase doubts. \u003cbr\u003e Habitual Buying Behavior â€“ Low involvement + few brand differences. Purchases are often repetitive, driven by familiarity rather than brand conviction. \u003cbr\u003e Variety-Seeking Buying Behavior â€“ Low involvement + significant brand differences. Consumers frequently switch brands for the sake of variety. \u003cbr\u003e The Buyer Decision Process \u003cbr\u003e The consumer buying decision process typically involves five stages: \u003cbr\u003e Need Recognition â€“ The consumer identifies a problem or need that can be satisfied by a product or service. \u003cbr\u003e Information Search â€“ The consumer seeks information to solve the need. \u003cbr\u003e May involve simple awareness (heightened attention) or active search. \u003cbr\u003e Sources of information include: \u003cbr\u003e Personal sources (family, friends) \u003cbr\u003e Commercial sources (advertising, salespeople) \u003cbr\u003e Public sources (media, consumer organizations) \u003cbr\u003e Experiential sources (using or testing the product) \u003cbr\u003e Evaluation of Alternatives â€“ The consumer compares and evaluates different brands or options based on the information gathered. \u003cbr\u003e Purchase Decision â€“ The consumer chooses which brand to buy. \u003cbr\u003e Influenced by attitudes of others and unexpected situational factors (e.g., price changes, product availability). \u003cbr\u003e Post-Purchase Behavior â€“ The consumer reflects on the purchase decision. \u003cbr\u003e Satisfaction or dissatisfaction depends on whether expectations match product performance. \u003cbr\u003e Cognitive dissonance (post-purchase conflict) may occur if doubts arise. \u003cbr\u003e Participants in the Business Buying Process \u003cbr\u003e The buying center includes all individuals and units involved in the purchase decision: \u003cbr\u003e Users â€“ Members of the organization who actually use the product or service. \u003cbr\u003e Influencers â€“ Define specifications, provide information, and help evaluate alternatives. \u003cbr\u003e Buyers â€“ Handle the formal purchasing process and place the order. \u003cbr\u003e Deciders â€“ Have the authority to select or approve the final suppliers. \u003cbr\u003e Gatekeepers â€“ Control the flow of information to others (e.g., secretaries, technical personnel). \u003cbr\u003e This way, the buyer decision process and the business buying center roles are separated and structured clearly. \u003cbr\u003e The Business Buying Process \u003cbr\u003e The business buying process typically involves eight stages through which organizations identify needs, evaluate alternatives, and manage supplier relationships: \u003cbr\u003e Problem Recognition â€“ Someone in the company identifies a problem or need that can be solved by purchasing a good or service. \u003cbr\u003e General Need Description â€“ The buyer outlines the general characteristics and quantity of the required item. \u003cbr\u003e Product Specification â€“ The buying organization determines and specifies the exact technical characteristics needed for the product or service. \u003cbr\u003e Supplier Search â€“ The buyer searches for the most suitable vendors to meet the requirement. \u003cbr\u003e Proposal Solicitation â€“ Qualified suppliers are invited to submit proposals or bids. \u003cbr\u003e Supplier Selection â€“ The buyer evaluates proposals and selects the supplier(s) that best meet the organizationâ€™s criteria. \u003cbr\u003e Order-Routine Specification â€“ The buyer finalizes the order, including product specifications, quantities, delivery schedules, return policies, and warranty terms. \u003cbr\u003e Performance Review â€“ The buyer evaluates the supplierâ€™s performance and decides whether to continue, modify, or terminate the relationship. \u003cbr\u003e Market Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market into smaller segments of buyers with distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors that may require separate marketing strategies or mixes. \u003cbr\u003e Major Bases for Market Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Geographic Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Divides the market into different geographical units such as nations, regions, states, cities, or neighborhoods. \u003cbr\u003e Example: A clothing brand may sell woolens in colder regions and cotton wear in warmer regions. \u003cbr\u003e Demographic Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Divides the market based on demographic variables such as age, gender, income, occupation, education, religion, race, nationality, and family life cycle. \u003cbr\u003e Examples: \u003cbr\u003e Age \u0026 Life-Cycle: Toys for children, retirement plans for seniors. \u003cbr\u003e Gender: Cosmetics for women, grooming products for men. \u003cbr\u003e Income: Luxury cars for high-income groups, budget cars for middle-income groups. \u003cbr\u003e Psychographic Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Divides the market based on social class, lifestyle, or personality traits. \u003cbr\u003e Example: Health-conscious consumers buying organic food; adventurous consumers preferring outdoor sports equipment. \u003cbr\u003e Behavioral Segmentation \u003cbr\u003e Divides the market based on consumer knowledge, attitudes, usage, or responses to a product. \u003cbr\u003e Types: \u003cbr\u003e Occasion Segmentation: Products purchased on special occasions (e.g., chocolates on Valentineâ€™s Day). \u003cbr\u003e Benefit Segmentation: Grouping based on benefits sought (e.g., toothpaste for whitening vs. sensitivity relief). \u003cbr\u003e User Status: Non-users, first-time users, regular users. \u003cbr\u003e Usage Rate: Light, medium, or heavy users. \u003cbr\u003e Loyalty Status: Brand-loyal customers vs. switchers. \u003cbr\u003e MARKET TARGETING \u003cbr\u003e Market targeting is the process of evaluating each market segmentâ€™s attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to enter. When evaluating segments, a marketer must look at segment size and growth, segment structural attractiveness and company objectives and resources. A target market consists of a set of buyers sharing common needs or characteristics that the company decides to serve. There are several forms of market targeting. \u003cbr\u003e Undifferentiated (mass) marketing: a marketing coverage strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and go after the whole market with one offer. \u003cbr\u003e Differentiated marketing or segmented marketing: a market-coverage strategy in which a firm decides to target several market segments and designs separate offers for each. \u003cbr\u003e Concentrated marketing (niche): a market-coverage strategy in which a firm goes after a large share of one or a few segments or niches. \u003cbr\u003e Micromarketing is tailoring products and marketing programs to the needs and wants of specific individuals and local customer segments. It includes local marketing: tailoring brands and promotions to the need and wants of local customer segments; cities, neighbourhoods and even specific stores. It also includes individual marketing: tailoring products and marketing programs to the needs and preferences of individual customers, also called one-to-one marketing, customized marketing and markets-of-one marketing. \u003cbr\u003e Companies need to consider a lot of factors when deciding upon a targeting strategy, such as available resources, market variability and competitorsâ€™ marketing strategies. \u003cbr\u003e DIFFERENTIATION AND POSITIONING \u003cbr\u003e Differentiation means differentiating the market offering to create superior customer value. Positioning is arranging for a market offering to occupy a clear, distinctive and desirable place relative to competing products in the mind of target consumers. A product position is the way the product is defined by consumers on important attributes: the place the product occupies in the consumersâ€™ minds relative to competing products. Perceptual positioning maps show consumer perceptions of brands versus competing products. \u003cbr\u003e A positioning statement is a statement that summarizes company or brand positioning. It takes this form: To (target segment and needs) our (brand) is (concept) that (point of difference). Once a position is chosen, a company must take action to deliver and communicate the position to its target customers. \u003cbr\u003e BRANDING \u003cbr\u003e Brand equity is the differential effect that knowing the brand name has on customer response to the product or its marketing. Brand equity can be a powerful asset. Brand valuation is the process of estimating the total financial value of a brand. In order to build a strong brand, there are some major brand strategy decisions to be made. Brand positioning involves positioning the brand in the mind of the consumer. Brand name selection is important in order to select a good name. The brand name should say something about the service benefits and should be easy to pronounce and remember. It needs to be distinctive and extendable, easily translated and should be capable of legal protection. \u003cbr\u003e Brand sponsorship can be done via four ways. A product can be launched as a national (manufacturer) brand or as a private brand or store brand. Another way is via licensed brands or a co-brand with another company. A store brand is a brand created and owned by a reseller of a product or service. Licensing involves lending the brand name to other manufacturers. Co-branding is the practice of using the established brand names of two different companies on the same product. \u003cbr\u003e When developing brands, companies have four choices. Line extensions occur when extending an existing brand name to new forms, colours, sizes, ingredients or flavours of an existing product category. A brand \u003cbr\u003e extension extends a current brand name to new product categories. Multibrands means offering more than one brand in the same category. New brands can be created when believed that the power of existing brands is fading. \u003cbr\u003e The product life cycle (PLC) is the course of productâ€™s sales and profits over its lifetime. It involves five \u003cbr\u003e distinct stages: \u003cbr\u003e Product development: development of the idea without any sales. \u003cbr\u003e Introduction: slow sales growth when the product is introduced. \u003cbr\u003e Growth: period of rapid acceptance. \u003cbr\u003e Maturity: period of sale slowdown because of acceptance by most potential buyers. \u003cbr\u003e Decline: the period when sales fall and the profit drops. \u003cbr\u003e The PLC concept can also be applied to styles, fashions and fads. A style is a basic and distinctive mode of expression. Fashion is a currently accepted or popular style in a given field. Fad is temporary period of unusually high sales driven by consumer enthusiasm and immediate product or brand popularity. Companies must continually innovate to keep up with the cycle. There are different strategies for each stage. \u003cbr\u003e The introduction stage is the PLC stage in which a new product is first distributed and made available for purchase. Profits are generally low and the initial strategy must be consistent with product positioning. \u003cbr\u003e The growth stage is the stage in which a productâ€™s sales start climbing quickly. Profits increase and the firm faces a trade-off between high market share and high current profit. \u003cbr\u003e In the maturity stage, products sales are growing slowly or level off. The company tries to increase consumption by finding new consumers, also known as modifying the market. The company might also try to modify the product by changing characteristics. \u003cbr\u003e In the decline stage, the productâ€™s sales are declining or dropping to zero. Management might decide to \u003cbr\u003e maintain the brand, reposition it or drop a product from the line. \u003cbr\u003e Personal selling: are personal presentations by the firmâ€™s sales force for the purpose of making sales and building customer relationships. A salesperson is an individual representing a company to customers by performing one or more of the following activities: prospecting, communicating, selling, services, information gathering and relationship building. Personal selling is an interpersonal part of the promotion mix. The sales force is a link between the company and its customers. Sales people represent the company to customers, but at the same time they represent customers to a particular company. The sales force should work closely with other marketing functions in order to create value for its customers, but often sales and marketing are approached as different functions. \u003cbr\u003e The selling process are the steps that salespeople follow when selling, which include prospecting and qualifying, pre-approaching, presenting an demonstrating, handling objections, closing and following up. \u003cbr\u003e Prospecting: a salesperson or company identifies qualified potential customers. \u003cbr\u003e Pre-approaching: a salesperson learns as much as possible about a prospective customer before \u003cbr\u003e making a sales call. \u003cbr\u003e Approaching: a salesperson meets the customer for the first time. \u003cbr\u003e Presenting: a salesperson tells the â€œvalue storyâ€ to the buyers, showing how the companyâ€™s offer solves the customerâ€™s problems. \u003cbr\u003e Handling objections: a salesperson seeks out, clarifies and overcomes any customer objections to buying. \u003cbr\u003e Closing: a salesperson asks the customer for an order. \u003cbr\u003e Following up: a salesperson follows up after the sale to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat business. \u003cbr\u003e Sales promotion: short-term incentives to encourage the purchase or sale of product or service. Sales promotions tools are used by most companies and can be consumer promotions, trade promotions, business promotions and sales force promotions.

Direct marketing begins with a good customer database. \u003cbr\u003e A customer database is an organized collection of comprehensive data about individual customers or prospects, including geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioral data.

There are several major forms of direct marketing: \u003cbr\u003e Direct-mail marketing: direct marketing by sending an offer, announcement, reminder or other item to a person at a particular physical or virtual address. It can be used well for direct one-to-one communication, but can be resented as â€œjunk mailâ€. \u003cbr\u003e Catalogue marketing: direct marketing through print, video or digital catalogues that are mailed to select customers, made available in stores, or presented online.

In exchange for a fee (known as a premium), an insurer agrees to compensate the insured party for specific losses, damages, or injuries. Itâ€™s a strategic form of risk management, designed to protect individuals and businesses from the financial impact of uncertain or contingent events. \u003cbr\u003e Key Concepts \u003cbr\u003e Insurer: The company or entity that provides insurance coverage. \u003cbr\u003e Policyholder: The person or organization that purchases the insurance policy. \u003cbr\u003e Insured: The individual or entity covered under the policy terms. \u003cbr\u003e Perils: Specific risks or causes of loss that may trigger a claim (e.g., fire, theft, accident). \u003cbr\u003e Insurance Policies \u003cbr\u003e An insurance policy is a formal contract that outlines: \u003cbr\u003e The types of perils covered \u003cbr\u003e Any exclusions (whatâ€™s not covered) \u003cbr\u003e The terms and conditions for compensation \u003cbr\u003e Policies may cover one or multiple categories of risk. For instance: \u003cbr\u003e Vehicle insurance typically includes: \u003cbr\u003e Property risk: Protection against theft or damage to the vehicle \u003cbr\u003e Liability risk: Coverage for legal claims arising from accidents \u003cbr\u003e Why Insurance Matters \u003cbr\u003e By transferring risk to an insurer, individuals and businesses gain peace of mind and financial stability. Insurance helps ensure that unexpected eventsâ€”whether minor mishaps or major catastrophesâ€”donâ€™t derail long-term goals or financial health. \u003cbr\u003e Life Insurance: Definition and Key Concepts \u003cbr\u003e ðŸ”¹ Definition \u003cbr\u003e Life insurance is a contractual agreement between an insurer and an insured individual. Under this contract, the insurer commits to paying a predetermined sum of moneyâ€”known as the death benefitâ€” to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the insured. In exchange, the policyholder pays regular premiums to the insurer. \u003cbr\u003e This financial arrangement provides economic protection to the insuredâ€™s dependents, helping them manage expenses, repay debts, and maintain financial stability after the loss of income due to the insuredâ€™s death. \u003cbr\u003e Human Life Value (HLV) Concept \u003cbr\u003e The Human Life Value (HLV) is a method used to estimate the economic worth of an individualâ€™s life. It helps determine the appropriate amount of life insurance coverage by calculating the financial loss that would occur if the individual were to pass away. \u003cbr\u003e Factors Considered in HLV: \u003cbr\u003e Present and future income \u003cbr\u003e Expenses and liabilities \u003cbr\u003e Savings and investments \u003cbr\u003e Number of dependents \u003cbr\u003e Remaining working years \u003cbr\u003e HLV ensures that the recommended coverage reflects the insuredâ€™s financial contribution to their family \u003cbr\u003e or dependents, making it a vital tool in life insurance planning. \u003cbr\u003e Purpose of Life Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Provides financial security to dependents \u003cbr\u003e Helps cover funeral costs, debts, and living expenses \u003cbr\u003e Acts as a tool for wealth transfer and estate planning \u003cbr\u003e Can be used for savings or investment, depending on the policy type \u003cbr\u003e Human Life Value (HLV) Concept \u003cbr\u003e Human Life Value (HLV) is a method used to estimate the economic value of a personâ€™s life based on their financial contribution to their family or dependents. It helps determine how much life insurance coverage is appropriate to ensure that loved ones are financially secure if the insured person passes away. \u003cbr\u003e Purpose of HLV \u003cbr\u003e To calculate the amount of life insurance needed \u003cbr\u003e To replace the income the insured would have earned over their working life \u003cbr\u003e To cover future expenses, liabilities, and financial goals of dependents \u003cbr\u003e HLV Calculation â€“ Key Factors \u003cbr\u003e HLV is typically calculated using the following: \u003cbr\u003e Annual income of the individual \u003cbr\u003e Number of working years remaining until retirement \u003cbr\u003e Personal expenses (amount not contributed to dependents) \u003cbr\u003e Inflation and discount rates (for present value calculation) \u003cbr\u003e Example: Calculating HLV \u003cbr\u003e Letâ€™s say we have Mr. Arjun, aged 35, earning â‚¹10,00,000 per year. He plans to retire at 60, so he has 25 working years left. He spends â‚¹3,00,000 on personal expenses annually, so his contribution to the family is â‚¹7,00,000 per year. \u003cbr\u003e Assuming no inflation or discounting for simplicity: \u003cbr\u003e HLV = Annual Contribution Ã— Number of Working Years \u003cbr\u003e HLV = â‚¹7,00,000 Ã— 25 = â‚¹1,75,00,000 \u003cbr\u003e So, Mr. Arjun should ideally have a life insurance cover of â‚¹1.75 crore to financially protect his family in case of his untimely death. \u003cbr\u003e What Is Health Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Health insurance is a contractual agreement between an individual (or group) and an insurance provider, where the insurer agrees to cover medical expenses incurred due to illness, injury, or other health-related conditions. In exchange, the insured pays a premium, either monthly, quarterly, or annually. \u003cbr\u003e It acts as a financial safety net, helping individuals manage the high costs of healthcare without depleting their savings. \u003cbr\u003e Types of Health Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Individual Health Insurance â€“ Covers a single person \u003cbr\u003e Family Floater Policy â€“ Covers entire family under one sum insured \u003cbr\u003e Critical Illness Insurance â€“ Covers life-threatening diseases like cancer, heart attack \u003cbr\u003e Group Health Insurance â€“ Offered by employers to employees \u003cbr\u003e Top-Up Plans â€“ Additional coverage beyond a base policy Benefits of Health Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers hospitalization costs, surgery, doctor consultations, diagnostics \u003cbr\u003e Offers cashless treatment at network hospitals \u003cbr\u003e Provides tax benefits under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act (India) \u003cbr\u003e Reduces financial burden during medical emergencies \u003cbr\u003e Encourages preventive care and regular health check-ups \u003cbr\u003e Definition of General insurance \u003cbr\u003e General insurance refers to all types of insurance other than life insurance. It provides financial protection against losses or damages to assets such as property, vehicles, health, and liability. These policies are typically short-term contracts, renewed annually or as specified. \u003cbr\u003e Key Characteristics \u003cbr\u003e Covers non-life risks \u003cbr\u003e Provides compensation for financial loss due to unforeseen events \u003cbr\u003e Includes property, liability, and personal insurance \u003cbr\u003e TypeDescriptionHealth InsuranceCovers medical expenses due to illness or injuryMotor InsuranceCovers damage to vehicles and third-party liabilityHome InsuranceProtects against damage to residential property due to fire, theft, etc.TypeDescriptionHealth InsuranceCovers medical expenses due to illness or injuryMotor InsuranceCovers damage to vehicles and third-party liabilityHome InsuranceProtects against damage to residential property due to fire, theft, etc.Premiums are based on risk assessment and coverage amount Types of General Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Type \u003cbr\u003e Description \u003cbr\u003e Health Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers medical expenses due to illness or injury \u003cbr\u003e Motor Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers damage to vehicles and third-party liability \u003cbr\u003e Home Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Protects against damage to residential property due to fire, theft, etc. \u003cbr\u003e Type \u003cbr\u003e Description \u003cbr\u003e Health Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers medical expenses due to illness or injury \u003cbr\u003e Motor Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers damage to vehicles and third-party liability \u003cbr\u003e Home Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Protects against damage to residential property due to fire, theft, etc. \u003cbr\u003e Travel Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers risks during travel such as trip cancellation, medical emergencies \u003cbr\u003e Commercial Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Protects businesses against risks like fire, theft, liability \u003cbr\u003e Marine Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Covers loss or damage to goods during transit over water \u003cbr\u003e Fire Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Provides coverage against losses caused by fire \u003cbr\u003e Importance of General Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Safeguards assets and wealth \u003cbr\u003e Reduces financial burden during emergencies \u003cbr\u003e Encourages risk management \u003cbr\u003e Supports economic stability for individuals and businesses \u003cbr\u003e Life Insurance at Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank \u003cbr\u003e Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank and the contracted insurance companies.

This shall be important in determining the extent of a customer\u0027s liability. \u003cbr\u003e The bank may not offer facility of electronic transactions, other than ATM cash withdrawals, to customers who do not provide mobile numbers to the bank. \u003cbr\u003e Password Policy \u003cbr\u003e Strong passwords are the first line of defence in protecting business data, preventing unauthorised access and ensuring confidentiality towards customer information. A strong Password Policy is vital to helping organizations protect critical systems and data, ensure business continuity and minimize compliance risk. \u003cbr\u003e Bank shall implement appropriate password controls for selection, usage and recycling of passwords for protecting information assets of the Bank and its customers. Application software in Bank will have to comply with minimum password standards as specified in this document. \u003cbr\u003e Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords, the protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change of the passwords. \u003cbr\u003e A password policy is a set of rules and regulations dictating how employees should create and use passwords. Password policy outline requirements such as minimum length, composition and complexity, expiration dates, storage, etc. \u003cbr\u003e Being a business owner, strong password policy, help to protect intrusion into banking system, restrict towards un authorised access and also protect digital assets. Through strong password we can prevent cybercriminals from accessing accounts and systems. \u003cbr\u003e In recent years, there has been a notable shift from traditional passwords towards more secure and user- friendly authentication methods. The emergence of passphrases-longer sequences of words that are easier for users to remember but harder for attackers to crack-has gained popularity. Passphrases offer a balance between security and convenience, making them an effective alternative to complex passwords. \u003cbr\u003e Additionally, password less authentication methods, such as biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition) and hardware tokens (e.g., security keys), are becoming increasingly common. These methods provide stronger security by eliminating the need for users to remember or manage passwords, reducing the risk of phishing and other password-related attacks. \u003cbr\u003e Scope of the Policy: The policy will cover the password parameters for Banking. Software Finacle, Biometric Solutions Portal, Internet Banking Services, Mobile Banking Services. \u003cbr\u003e This document addresses Policies and Standards related to the password security and controls of the Bank\u0027s information resources. \u003cbr\u003e This Policy applies to all Bank employees and respective outsourced parties who need access to Bank\u0027s information resources. The information resources covered under this policy include system and application software, servers and desktops, and networking/security components. \u003cbr\u003e Definition \u003cbr\u003e The encrypted password or password hash The part of your password that is generated from your actual password and stored on the system that you are authenticating to. When you type your password to log onto your computer, the password is encrypted. The encrypted password is compared against a stored encrypted password. If the two values are the same then you are granted access. It is this encrypted password or password hash that attackers may intercept as it travels across the network or is stored on a computer. \u003cbr\u003e Password cracking - Attempting to break the encrypted password or password hash. \u003cbr\u003e Brute-force attack A type of password cracking where every possible character combination is tried until a match is found. Brute-force attacks may be conducted online or offline. Depending on the type of brute- force attack, a direct interface to the authentication infrastructure (for example, Active Directory) or a locally stored copy of the encrypted password or password hash is needed in order to verify if the password guess is correct. \u003cbr\u003e Dictionary attack A type of password cracking where common words, phrases, and combinations of characters are tried until a match is found. \u003cbr\u003e Password expiration or lifetime - The maximum amount of time between password changes. \u003cbr\u003e Password complexity The structure of the characters that are required to form a password. These typically consist of a required combination of alphabetic lowercase, alphabetic uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Other rules, such as prohibiting words commonly found in dictionaries, also contribute to password complexity. \u003cbr\u003e Minimum password length The number of characters that are required to form a password. Combined with password complexity and password expiration or lifetime, password length plays a large part in determining the strength of a password. \u003cbr\u003e Key Parameters of Password1. Password LengthKey Parameters of Password1. Password Length \u003cbr\u003e Key Parameters of Password \u003cbr\u003e 1. Password Length \u003cbr\u003e Key Parameters of Password \u003cbr\u003e 1. Password Length \u003cbr\u003e Password length is the most crucial factor in a strong password policy. It is recommended that passwords should be as per the length prescribed for users. Strong password as per defined length is a preventive measure towards cracking of a password and protects from unauthorised access. \u003cbr\u003e A strong password provides the greatest protection against brute force attacks. These attacks happen when a hacker tries to gain access to your account by using technology to try every possible password combination until they find the right one. \u003cbr\u003e Password Complexity \u003cbr\u003e Password complexity is the next most important factor in a robust password policy. It refers to combining various types of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and other special characters to form a single password. Alternatively, passphrases that combine 4-5 randomly chosen words are also a good password strategy. \u003cbr\u003e Password Expiration \u003cbr\u003e Passwords/PINs needed to be changed regularly with in stipulated timeframe as prescribed. \u003cbr\u003e Multi-Factor Authentication \u003cbr\u003e Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a critical security measure that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user\u0027s identity. For example, in addition to a password, a user must provide another form of authentication to access an account, such as a fingerprint or a one-time code sent to a different device. \u003cbr\u003e MFA adds an extra layer of security to help to prevent unauthorized access to accounts and systems. It also makes it more difficult for attackers to compromise accounts, as they would need to obtain multiple forms of authentication to gain access. In addition, MFA can help to reduce the risk of account takeover and other types of cyber-attacks and provides peace of mind for users, knowing that their accounts are better protected. \u003cbr\u003e Password History \u003cbr\u003e A password history policy determines the number of unique new passwords that must be associated with a user account before the user can reuse old passwords. Password reuse is a common problem as most \u003cbr\u003e users find it easier to reuse passwords for a long time rather than create a new one. Unfortunately, the longer the same password is used for a particular account, the greater the chance that an attacker will be able to determine the password through brute-force attacks. If users are required to change their password but reuse an old password, the effectiveness of a good password policy is significantly reduced. \u003cbr\u003e Password Reuse \u003cbr\u003e While creating and managing multiple passwords, reuse of passwords must be avoided. The risks of password reuse are higher as, it\u0027s easy for any unauthorised user to check and see if any of the passwords they\u0027ve recently acquired may match with user credential. \u003cbr\u003e Password Sharing \u003cbr\u003e As password is a key element for access into system, through unauthorised access/login any unauthorised person can do anything up to permissible extent of -user/customer\u0027s power/limits. Password sharing makes personal and professional data vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and must be avoided at all times. \u003cbr\u003e Failed Login Attempts \u003cbr\u003e Failed login attempts may result from employees forgetting their login credentials or hackers attempting to access a user\u0027s account. Therefore, monitoring and managing failed login attempts is of the utmost importance, as they can lead to privacy and personal data breaches. \u003cbr\u003e A temporary account/login lockout (with certain time frame) after fix consecutive failed attempts or time- doubling throttling (in defined minutes) between each retry (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) will be set in the system. A permanent account lockout occurs after defined consecutive failed attempts and re-registration/reset activity will be done as per the services. \u003cbr\u003e Password Screening \u003cbr\u003e The replication of credentials significantly heightens the risk of unauthorized access to user which may lead potentially exposing sensitive information as well as unauthorised login. In cases where a user enters an incorrect password, the system should provide a clear message prompting them to choose a different one while explaining why their initial choice was rejected. \u003cbr\u003e Standards and Guidelines: \u003cbr\u003e Confidentiality of passwords \u003cbr\u003e Passwords should remain confidential and not be shared, posted or otherwise divulged in any manner. \u003cbr\u003e All access codes including user ID passwords, network passwords, PINs etc. shall not be shared with anyone, including colleagues, personal assistants and family members. These should be treated as sensitive, confidential information. \u003cbr\u003e Passwords should not be revealed to the controlling officer or any co-worker even while on vacation. \u003cbr\u003e Users shall be responsible for all activity performed with their user IDs. Users shall not permit others to perform any activity with their user IDs or perform any activity with IDs belonging to other users. \u003cbr\u003e Passwords must not be communicated through e-mail messages or other forms of electronic communication. \u003cbr\u003e Passwords shall not be revealed on questionnaires or security forms.No password shall be traveling in clear text; the hashed form of the password should be used. To get around the possibility of replay of the hashed password, it shall be used along with a randomization parameter. \u003cbr\u003e The backend database shall store hash of the individual passwords and never passwords in readable form. \u003cbr\u003e Password Management \u003cbr\u003e Bank will follow the password composition guidelines mentioned in the policy. If systems do not support these settings an exception must be filed to that effect. \u003cbr\u003e All user/customer-level passwords associated with Banking Software Finacle, Biometric Solutions Portal, Internet Banking Services, Mobile Banking Services shall be changed periodically as per mentioned norms. Users shall not be able to reuse previous passwords up to defined time frame. \u003cbr\u003e Password shall be enforced to be of a minimum length and comprising of mix of alphabets, numbers and characters. \u003cbr\u003e Passwords shall not be stored in readable form in batch files, automatic logon scripts, Internet browsers or related data communication software, in computers without access control, or in any other location where unauthorized persons might discover or use them. \u003cbr\u003e All PINs (Personal Identification Numbers) shall be constructed with the defined rules. \u003cbr\u003e The \"Remember Password\" feature of applications shall not be used. \u003cbr\u003e On first time login or in case of password reset into systems/services applications with administrator created passwords, should force changing of password by the user. \u003cbr\u003e The password shall be changed immediately if the password is suspected of being disclosed, or known to have been disclosed to an unauthorized party. \u003cbr\u003e Password shall be enforced to be of a minimum length and comprising of mix of alphabets, numbers and characters. \u003cbr\u003e Users shall be required to change their passwords periodically and not be able to reuse previous passwords. \u003cbr\u003e For Password Change Control, both the old and new passwords are required to be given whenever a password change is required. \u003cbr\u003e There shall be a system to ensure that users should be notified to change their password. \u003cbr\u003e The user-ID and password should be authenticated as a whole. Authentication failure should provide an error message to the user that indicates an incorrect login. The error message must not indicate whether the user ID is right or wrong. (e.g. \"incorrect login\" or \"incorrect password\"). \u003cbr\u003e Files containing passwords should be encrypted. \u003cbr\u003e Passwords should be entered in non-display fields. \u003cbr\u003e Suggestions for choosing passwords: Passwords may be chosen such that they are difficult-to-guess yet easy-to- remember. Methods such as the following may be employed \u003cbr\u003e String together several words to form a pass-phrase as a password. \u003cbr\u003e Transform a regular word according to a specific method e.g. making every other letter a number reflecting its position in the word. \u003cbr\u003e Combine punctuation and/or numbers with a regular word. \u003cbr\u003e Create acronyms from words in a song, a poem, or any other known sequence of words. \u003cbr\u003e Bump characters in a word a certain number of letters up or down the alphabet. \u003cbr\u003e The password shall not be a word found in a dictionary (English or foreign). \u003cbr\u003e The password shall not be a common usage word such as names of family, pets, friends, co-workers, fantasy characters, etc. \u003cbr\u003e The password shall not be based on computer terms and names, commands, sites, companies, hardware, software. The password shall not be based on birthdays and other personal information such as addresses and phone numbers. \u003cbr\u003e The password shall not be a word or number pattern like aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, 123321, etc. or any of the above spelled backwards. \u003cbr\u003e OUTSOURCING POLICY FOR IT SERVICESOUTSOURCING POLICY FOR IT SERVICES \u003cbr\u003e OUTSOURCING POLICY FOR IT SERVICES

The salient features of Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021 as effective from November 12, 2021 are \u003cbr\u003e properly displayed at all the Branches of the Bank as well as the Bankâ€™s website wherein the mode of \u003cbr\u003e lodgment of complaint and details of Nodal Officers of Bank are mentioned. \u003cbr\u003e The Bank reserves the right to modify its Grievance Redressal Process in the light of any change as per notification by the Regulators or as per requirement of the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e Monetary disincentives in the form of recovery of cost of redressal of complaints: Given that the Banker-customer relationship is the primary relationship, the main responsibility of customer grievance redressal lies with Banks. With a view to ensure that Banks discharge this responsibility effectively, the cost of redressal of complaints will now be recovered from those Banks against whom the maintainable complaints in the OBOs exceed their peer group average. However, grievance redress under Banking Ombudsman Scheme for customers will continue to remain cost-free. To operationalize the cost-recovery framework for Banks, peer groups based on the asset size of Banks as on March 31 of the previous year will be identified, and peer group average of maintainable complaints received in OBOs would be computed on the following parameters: \u003cbr\u003e Average number of maintainable complaints per branch; \u003cbr\u003e Average number of maintainable complaints per 1000 accounts (total of deposit and credit accounts) held by the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e Average number of maintainable digital complaints per 1000 digital transactions executed through the bank by its customers. \u003cbr\u003e The cost of redressing complaints in excess of the peer group average will be recovered from the Bank as follows: \u003cbr\u003e Excess in any one Parameter- 30% of the cost of redressing a complaint (in the OBO) for the number of complaints in excess of the peer group average. \u003cbr\u003e Excess in any two parameters-60% of the cost of redressing a complaint for the number of complaints exceeding the peer group average in the parameter with the higher excess. \u003cbr\u003e Excess in all the three parameters-100% of the cost of redressing a complaint for the number of complaints exceeding the peer group in the parameter with the highest excess. \u003cbr\u003e The cost of redressal to be recovered in this respect will be the average cost of handling a complaint at the OBOs during the year. \u003cbr\u003e Mandatory display requirements: It is mandatory for the Bank to provide: \u003cbr\u003e Appropriate arrangement for receiving complaints and suggestions. \u003cbr\u003e The name, address and contact number of Nodal Officer(s) \u003cbr\u003e Name, address, phone no., email of the Principal Nodal Officer \u003cbr\u003e Contact details of Banking Ombudsman \u003cbr\u003e Complaint Resolution Support for GRC(Grievance Redressal Cell) \u003cbr\u003e 3.CYBER SECURITY3.CYBER SECURITY \u003cbr\u003e 3.CYBER SECURITY \u003cbr\u003e 3.CYBER SECURITY \u003cbr\u003e Introduction: \u003cbr\u003e Information Technology that supports banking business functions are increasingly advanced, pervasive and connected, also they are increasingly being attacked by cyber criminals. Expressive growth of technology in business and the extended use of internet leaves most of the organization infrastructure connected to the cyberspace thus leaving the organization come under cyber-attacks. \u003cbr\u003e Technological advancements has led to a strong interconnectivity creating new opportunities for innovation and growth. But, this also escalated cyber security threats targeted at Banking and financial sector. It is imperative that every bank offering financial services to its users should adopt and implement an appropriate cyber security protection policy to safeguard its customers and business. \u003cbr\u003e CYBER SECURITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY: \u003cbr\u003e It is important for one to understand the distinction between Cyber Security and Information Security, often there are large overlap of controls in information security and cyber security. Information Security is completely focused on the confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the information, where information can be in either electronic format (digital) and hardcopy format. \u003cbr\u003e Cyber security is focused on protection of information in electronic format, organization brand and reputation from the threats originating from cyber space. For example, threats like dumpster diving, electric power fluctuation, flood, etc., will not be considered in a cyber-security environment, because these threats do not originate from the cyber realm. \u003cbr\u003e In short, we can consider Cyber Security as a subset of Information security, however the cyber security has to be remain a distinctive security framework mainly for the reason: \u003cbr\u003e Cyber Security is all about protecting against threats from cyber realm. \u003cbr\u003e Cyber Threats are more dynamic and growing at a rapid pace. \u003cbr\u003e Cyber Security controls designs are focused only on electronic format IT assets only. \u003cbr\u003e Bankâ€™s Cyber security framework is in-line with RBI Cyber Security Framework and other best practices \u003cbr\u003e to protect bankâ€™s valuable IT assets from cyber-attacks. \u003cbr\u003e Application of cyber security framework enables communication about security risk priorities and activities in business terms, turning potential organizational risk into competitive advantage. \u003cbr\u003e What Is Cyber Security? \u003cbr\u003e The term Cyber security refers to the techniques of protecting computers, networks, programs and data from unauthorized access or attacks that are aimed for exploitation. Cyber security Includes Application Security, Information Security, Disaster recovery and Network Security. \u003cbr\u003e Thus Cyber security is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working together to encompass the full range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery policies and activities, including computer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement, etc. \u003cbr\u003e WHY IS CYBER SECURITY IMPORTANT? \u003cbr\u003e Cyber-attacks can be extremely expensive for businesses to endure. \u003cbr\u003e In addition to financial damage suffered by the business, a data breach can also inflict untold reputational damage. \u003cbr\u003e Cyber-attacks these days are becoming progressively destructive. Cybercriminals are using more sophisticated ways to initiate cyber-attacks. \u003cbr\u003e WHAT IS A CYBER ATTACK? \u003cbr\u003e A cyber-attack is a deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology- dependent enterprises and networks. Cybercriminals use malicious code and software to alter computer code, logic, and data resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cyber-crimes such as theft of financial information or identity or infiltration into system. \u003cbr\u003e CYBER SECURITY IN RELATION TO BANKING SECTOR: \u003cbr\u003e Cyber security in Banks has gained paramount importance as Banks have opened up their IT platforms to customers in the wake of digitization, competition from peers, customer experience, reduction of transaction cost etc. Banks exchange and transmit sensitive data across networks and to other devices in the course of businesses, and cyber security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to process or store it. \u003cbr\u003e Securing technology systems and protecting the data and assets of customers remains one of the highest priorities for any financial institution. The unprecedented growth in digital payments in India and the Governmentâ€™s push towards a cashless economy has added many new customers to digital Banking, which in turn has brought renewed focus on the need to strengthen financial cyber security. Banks have scrambled to implement various new mobile banking technologies like Wallets, Utility Bill Payments, 24x7 money transfers etc. \u003cbr\u003e There is rise in misuse of Bankâ€™s SWIFT systems credentials for transfer of funds or letters of undertaking / line of credit through unlawful access to the bankâ€™s SWIFT Systems for cross-border transactions. In fact Reserve Bank of India has advised Banks to stop issuing LOUs and LOCs. \u003cbr\u003e Email became the Weapon of Choice for cybercrimes and Emails pose dangerous and efficient threats to users. Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, relying on spear- phishing emails, targeted on businesses every day are draining huge money from Customerâ€™s accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Some common Cyber-attack types and techniques- Viruses \u003cbr\u003e Viruses are the oldest form of cyber-attacks and the most popularized in early media. They are lines \u003cbr\u003e of code embedded in malware or phishing hooks. When opened, they disrupt a computerâ€™s normal \u003cbr\u003e operating habits. \u003cbr\u003e Malware Malware literally means â€œmalicious softwareâ€. Malware can be spyware, ransomware or adware, and it can carry a virus. Rather than embedding itself into the operating system or hard drive like a virus, it installs itself and runs as a software. \u003cbr\u003e Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks access to a victimâ€™s assets and demands money to restore that access. Ransomware typically blocks access to a victimâ€™s files through encryption. Once a victim is infected, the ransomware scans the available local and network systems for important files and encrypts the files and alerts the user about the infection. The alert includes a ransom demand and a deadline for payment. If victims do not pay in time, the ransomware destroys the decryption key and the victimsâ€™ files are rendered useless. If the payment is made in time, victims usually receive a decryption key to unlock their files. \u003cbr\u003e SQL Injection Attack An SQL injection attack works by exploiting any one of the known SQL vulnerabilities that allow the SQL server to run malicious code. Stealing or dumping customer information from the website, such as credit card numbers, usernames and passwords (credentials), or other personally identifiable information, which are tempting and lucrative targets for an attacker. \u003cbr\u003e Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Similar to an SQL injection attack, this attack also involves injecting malicious code into a website, but in this case the website itself is not being attacked. Instead, the malicious code the attacker has injected only runs in the user\u0027s browser when they visit the attacked website, and it goes after the visitor directly, not the website. \u003cbr\u003e Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) A distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack is an attack in which multiple compromised computer systems attack a target, such as a server, website or other network resource, and cause a denial of service for users of the targeted resource. The flood of incoming messages, connection requests or malformed packets to the target system forces it to slow down or even crash and shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users or systems. The motive of denial of service (DOS) is to render the target systems unavailable. \u003cbr\u003e Social engineering As network defenses are becoming increasingly hardened and therefore more resistant to cyber intrusion, social engineering provides a way to bypass security protocols that cybercriminals may not be able to overcome via technical means. Cybercriminals use social engineering techniques to manipulate human trust and elicit information in support of network exploitation efforts. Social engineering is becoming more sophisticated and is likely to be increasingly used by adversaries to disguise their illicit activities as genuine. \u003cbr\u003e Malicious Emails Phishing Phishing is an attempt to trick users into sharing personal details or login credentials. Attackers may do this by encouraging the user to respond to the email, or by asking them to click to a fraudulent website that prompts them to share information. A link in malicious email is almost twice likely to point to a phishing website than to malware. Spear phishing is simply a more targeted form of phishing. Rather than sending a single generic email to a list of millions of email addresses, spear phishing attacks send carefully crafted emails to smaller lists of targets. \u003cbr\u003e Business email compromise (BEC) also known as CEO fraud is a form of phishing attack where a cybercriminal impersonates an executive (often the CEO), and attempts to get an employee, customer, or vendor to transfer funds or sensitive information to the phisher. \u003cbr\u003e BEC attacks are highly focused. Cyber criminals will scrape compromised email inboxes, study recent company news, and research employees on social media sites in order to make these email attacks look as convincing as possible. \u003cbr\u003e Threats associated with outsourcingThreats associated with outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e Threats associated with outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e Threats associated with outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e Sophisticated cyber activity against Third Party Managed Service providers, vendors that provide services to Banks has increased. As it has become more difficult for adversaries to directly compromise their targets, adversaries have sought secondary or tertiary access into primary targets. The compromise of third party IT service providers can enable cyber adversaries to target and exploit customer data and networks through a range of direct and indirect means. \u003cbr\u003e Insider ThreatsInsider Threats \u003cbr\u003e Insider Threats \u003cbr\u003e Insider Threats \u003cbr\u003e While there are numerous threats aimed at bank systems and their customers, one of the biggest threats, and often one of the hardest to detect, is that of malicious, careless and compromised users. These employees, contractors and partners are already inside the banks secure perimeter and have legitimate access to its sensitive data and IT systems. \u003cbr\u003e Advanced Persistent ThreatsAdvanced Persistent Threats \u003cbr\u003e Advanced Persistent Threats \u003cbr\u003e Advanced Persistent Threats \u003cbr\u003e Advanced Persistent Threats, or APTs, are long, directed cyber-attacks that are most often state sponsored. These types of attacks usually begin with a network probe. An organization or individual illegally, and surreptitiously, accesses an organizationâ€™s local area network or internal internet. This individual may have gotten in through an employee access gateway or found a vulnerability through other means. The hacker will lurk on the network, hiding from detection, while it maps the information stored there and implements malicious measures. Often, results of APTs include theft. \u003cbr\u003e CyberspaceCyberspace \u003cbr\u003e Cyberspace \u003cbr\u003e Cyberspace \u003cbr\u003e Cyberspace can be defined as an intricate environment that involves interactions between people, software, and services. It is maintained by the worldwide distribution of information and communication technology devices and networks. \u003cbr\u003e With the benefits carried by the technological advancements, the cyberspace today has become a common pool used by citizens, businesses, critical information infrastructure, military and governments in a fashion that makes it hard to induce clear boundaries among these different groups. The cyberspace is anticipated to become even more complex in the upcoming years, with the increase in networks and devices connected to it. \u003cbr\u003e Policy on Collection of ChequesPolicy on Collection of Cheques \u003cbr\u003e Policy on Collection of Cheques \u003cbr\u003e Policy on Collection of Cheques \u003cbr\u003e Instruments like Demand Draft / Bankers Cheque, Interest / Dividend warrant etc., shall be treated at par with cheques. \u003cbr\u003e Preamble: \u003cbr\u003e This policy is based on Model Policy by IBA according to RBI/IBA guidelines.

Current ratio is arrived at by dividing, as on a date, total value of current assets by current liabilities. \u003cbr\u003e Current Ratio = Current Assets/ Current Liabilities \u003cbr\u003e DEBT EQUITY RATIO (3:1) this ratio indicates relationship between the external term borrowings and the own funds of the concern. Bank takes total term liabilities as Debt i.e. total liabilities minus net worth and total current liabilities. Equity means net worth of the concern minus intangible and fictitious assets. However, the subordinated funds (i.e. long-term unsecured loans from friends and relatives, etc.) may be considered as quasi-equity, generally for non-corporate borrowers, and included in equity while arriving at ratio, if the borrower retains the same at the existing level/ projected level during the currency of Bank Loan. The subordinated debt however should not exceed borrowerâ€™s tier I capital i.e. capital plus free reserves less intangible assets. \u003cbr\u003e Debt-Equity Ratio = Total Term Liabilities (TTL)/Tangible Net Worth (TNW) \u003cbr\u003e A ratio of 3:1 is considered satisfactory. However, higher ratio may be allowed keeping in view the activity of the borrower, industry, sectoral classification such as SSI units, other priority sector advances etc. \u003cbr\u003e Fixed Assets Coverage Ratio (Applicable for Term Loan): Fixed Assets Coverage Ratio = Net Fixed Assets / Term Debts (Medium \u0026 Long) \u003cbr\u003e Fixed Assets Coverage Ratio of more than 1 is considered reasonable \u003cbr\u003e Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) (Applicable for term loan): \u003cbr\u003e DSCR = (Profit after tax + Depreciation + Int. on TL) / (Int. on TL+TL Installments). \u003cbr\u003e The average DSCR (i.e. the sum of numerator divided by the sum of denominator of DSCR formula as stated above for entire repayment period of the loan) of 1.50 is considered reasonable. \u003cbr\u003e However, in any year it should not be less than 1.25(1 in case of SME). The sanctioning authority may consider lower average DSCR depending upon the nature of project / Industry after recording the reasons for the same. \u003cbr\u003e Takeover of Corporate \u0026 MSME (Regulatory \u0026 Expanded definition) Accounts: \u003cbr\u003e Non-Financial Guidelines: \u003cbr\u003e The specific reasons for shifting the account from financial institution / other bank to the Bank should be ascertained. \u003cbr\u003e Accounts of profit making (i.e. net profit before tax) concerns as per last two audited balance sheets should only be considered \u003cbr\u003e Before taking over, Bank should obtain necessary credit information from the transferor bank as per the format prescribed on â€œLending under Consortium Arrangement/Multiple Banking Arrangementsâ€ and / or Latest statement of account of the existing banks for preceding 6/12 months is to be obtained and verified to assess the quality of operations with the existing bankers. \u003cbr\u003e Besides obtaining Credit Report from the existing lenders, Branches to make discrete inquiries with people in the similar line of activity / buyers / suppliers and their view about the prospective borrower\u0027s credentials, financial soundness, integrity, reputation and capability (amount proposed to be taken over) must be obtained. A confirmation to this effect must form a part of comments in the takeover proposals. \u003cbr\u003e As a general policy, takeover should be at the existing exposure level only. However, the additional exposure at the time of takeover can be considered on merit of case. \u003cbr\u003e External Rating in respect of credit proposal with exposure above Rs.5.00 crores by approved credit rating agencies should not be below BBB \u0026 equivalent. \u003cbr\u003e Concessionary facilities to â€œTaken over Accountsâ€ should be extended only in extremely deserving \u003cbr\u003e cases with specific reasons recorded in writing. \u003cbr\u003e There should be tangible security available to cover the advances to be taken over and the underlying assets should be distinctly identifiable. \u003cbr\u003e For Term Loan / Project Finance, the project should not be in the implementation phase at the time of takeover of the loan. In other words, it should have commenced commercial production. The remaining repayment period shall not be extended beyond the original repayment period permitted by the erstwhile lender, as it amounts to restructuring of account. However, this provision will not be applicable in respect of refinance of loan s as allowed by the RBI. \u003cbr\u003e Financial norms in case of takeover of SME accounts as per regulatory guidelines:Financial norms in case of takeover of SME accounts as per regulatory guidelines:Take over accounts are to be rated not less than â€œBâ€. \u003cbr\u003e Financial norms in case of takeover of SME accounts as per regulatory guidelines: \u003cbr\u003e Financial norms in case of takeover of SME accounts as per regulatory guidelines: \u003cbr\u003e Ratios \u003cbr\u003e Norms \u003cbr\u003e Authority for deviation \u003cbr\u003e 1 \u003cbr\u003e 2 \u003cbr\u003e Micro \u0026 Small Industries under Manufacturing sector and service Sector as per regulatory guidelines \u003cbr\u003e Medium Enterprises under manufacturing sector and \u003cbr\u003e service Sector as per regulatory guidelines \u003cbr\u003e Chairman only \u003cbr\u003e Current Ratio \u003cbr\u003e Minimum 1.17 \u0026 above \u003cbr\u003e Minimum 1.20 \u0026 above \u003cbr\u003e -do- \u003cbr\u003e Debt Equity Ratio \u003cbr\u003e (TTL / TNW) \u003cbr\u003e Maximum 4:1 \u003cbr\u003e Maximum 3:1 \u003cbr\u003e -do- \u003cbr\u003e Total outside liability/ TNW \u003cbr\u003e Maximum 4:1 \u003cbr\u003e Maximum 4:1 \u003cbr\u003e -do- \u003cbr\u003e Average DSCR for Term Loan \u003cbr\u003e Minimum 1.50 with a condition that in any one year it should not be below 1.25 \u003cbr\u003e Minimum 1.50 with a condition that in any one year it should not be below \u003cbr\u003e 1.25 \u003cbr\u003e -do- \u003cbr\u003e Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro \u0026 Small Enterprises under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE)Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro \u0026 Small Enterprises under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) \u003cbr\u003e Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro \u0026 Small Enterprises under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) \u003cbr\u003e Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro \u0026 Small Enterprises under Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) \u003cbr\u003e Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) has granted us Member Lending Institution (MLI) status and made us eligible to cover our MSMEs advances with the guarantee cover of trust. \u003cbr\u003e PM SVANidhi YojanaPM SVANidhi YojanaREF:- CIR NO.

This has necessitated the needs for more structural solutions and answers to manage their compliance risk and make them more robust and sustainable over time. Penal provisions are also introduced wherever non-compliance is noticed by the regulators. This fact combined with the resulting financial cost and reputation damage, makes it essential for commercial organizations including Banks \u0026 Financial Institutions to think seriously about how best to manage Compliance Risk. \u003cbr\u003e Need: Compliance failures lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties, making effective compliance critical. \u003cbr\u003e Benefits of Compliance Culture: \u003cbr\u003e Low organizational and individual risk; \u003cbr\u003e Low reputational risk; \u003cbr\u003e Less hesitance and more confidence among employees while performing their jobs; \u003cbr\u003e Helps attract and retain talent and ensure employee engagement. \u003cbr\u003e Improved transparency which enables better decisions; \u003cbr\u003e Enhanced relationship with regulators and other stakeholders and \u003cbr\u003e Enhanced valuation among investors;. \u003cbr\u003e The guidelines on compliance and compliance function issued by NABARD has to introduce certain principles, standards and procedures relating to compliance function consistent with the BASEL Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) document ( April -2005) and keeping in view the operating environment in the country.

The internal audit function is considered an indispensable part of a bank\u0027s safe and sound operations, serving as the third line of defence in the bank\u0027s risk management model. The first line of defence is the operations/business units, which are responsible for preventing risk at the source. The second line of defence consists of the compliance and risk management functions. \u003cbr\u003e The policy provides a comprehensive framework for the internal audit function to independently assess the effectiveness of the bank\u0027s internal controls, risk management, and governance systems and processes. \u003cbr\u003e Objectives of RBIA \u003cbr\u003e The primary objectives of the RBIA system are to: \u003cbr\u003e Provide independent assurance to the Board and Senior Management on the quality and effectiveness of the bank\u0027s internal controls and risk management. \u003cbr\u003e Ensure the independence and objectivity of audit activities. \u003cbr\u003e Maintain the professional competence of the internal audit function. \u003cbr\u003e Design and implement a risk-based internal audit plan. \u003cbr\u003e Enable the identification and prioritization of audit areas and the allocation of resources based on risk assessment. \u003cbr\u003e Ensure that every bank activity and entity, including outsourced activities, is within the scope of internal audit. \u003cbr\u003e Anticipate potential risks and provide suggestions to safeguard the bank. \u003cbr\u003e Act as a deterrent and preventive mechanism against fraud. \u003cbr\u003e Follow up on the rectification of irregularities and assess the level of compliance with internal and regulatory instructions. \u003cbr\u003e Allow auditors access to all bank information, records, systems, and personnel. \u003cbr\u003e RBIA Framework \u003cbr\u003e The RBIA framework is built on two key principles: independence and a defined structure. \u003cbr\u003e Independence \u003cbr\u003e The internal audit function must be independent from the internal control process to avoid conflicts of interest. The Board of Directors and top management are responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the RBIA system. While the internal audit function itself cannot be outsourced, experts can be hired \u003cbr\u003e on a contractual basis if the necessary expertise is not available internally. The ownership of all audit reports remains with the regular functionaries of the internal audit department. \u003cbr\u003e Structure \u003cbr\u003e The framework is headed by the General Manager, who reports to the Chairman and the Board of Directors. The General Manager also convenes the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB). The \u003cbr\u003e Central Audit Committee (CAC) is headed by the Chairman, and all Regional Heads are members. The \u003cbr\u003e Sub Committee of CAC is headed by the General Manager. \u003cbr\u003e Execution \u003cbr\u003e The audit framework is divided into two main parts: \u003cbr\u003e Centralized Audit/Inspection: The Inspection Department, under the supervision of the Head of the Audit \u0026 Inspection Department, conducts on-site audits of branches. \u003cbr\u003e Off-site Audit/Inspection: A Desk Officer at the Regional Office monitors transactions through the CBS (Core Banking System) and communicates with branches for rectification. Compliance is monitored through the Regional Audit Committee (RAC) and discussed at the Sub Committee of CAC and CAC meetings. \u003cbr\u003e Types of Audits and Inspections \u003cbr\u003e The Audit \u0026 Inspection Department conducts various types of audits and inspections under the RBIA framework: \u003cbr\u003e Risk-Based Internal Audit: The primary audit type that assesses the overall risk profile of a branch. \u003cbr\u003e H.R. Audit/Inspection: \u003cbr\u003e A systematic process to examine HR functions, including manpower utilization, leave, and salary administration. It is carried out as an integral part of the regular branch inspection. \u003cbr\u003e Information System (IS) Audit/Inspection: Aims to preserve the value of IT assets by checking environmental controls, physical and logical access, and report preservation. This is also part of the regular branch inspection. \u003cbr\u003e Revenue Audit/Inspection: Focuses on preventing income leakage from incorrect or non- application of various charges and interest. This is also part of the regular inspection. \u003cbr\u003e VLE Centre Inspection: The Inspecting Officer visits these centers to check for KYC compliance, document maintenance, and adherence to prescribed norms. This is part of the regular branch inspection. \u003cbr\u003e Zero Tolerance Areas: A verification of critically sensitive issues conducted on the first and last day of the RBIA. Parameters include KYC compliance, handling of debit cards, signature scanning, and filing of exceptional reports. \u003cbr\u003e Audit Planning and Risk Assessment \u003cbr\u003e The Audit \u0026 Inspection department conducts an annual exercise to identify branches for RBIA. The frequency of a branch inspection is determined by its \u003cbr\u003e Composite Risk category. \u003cbr\u003e High-Risk Branches: Inspected every 9 months. \u003cbr\u003e Medium-Risk Branches: Inspected every 12 months. \u003cbr\u003e Low-Risk Branches (not under concurrent audit): Inspected every 12 to 15 months. \u003cbr\u003e Low-Risk Branches (under concurrent audit): Inspected every 15 to 18 months. \u003cbr\u003e Risk assessment is a process of evaluating each product and process for their risks. The bank uses \u003cbr\u003e Risk Profile Templates (RPT) to determine the level of risk a branch is exposed to. Risks are divided into three types: \u003cbr\u003e Business Risk, Control Risk, and Business Performance Risk. However, only Business Risk and Control Risk are used to determine the Composite Risk Category. Each of these two risks is graded on a scale of up to 500 marks. A score of 351-500 is considered Low Risk, 201-350 is Medium Risk, and 1-200 is High Risk. \u003cbr\u003e A branch\u0027s overall performance is rated based on a total score out of 1500, which includes marks for all three risk types. For example, a branch with a score of over 1200 is an \"Effectively Run Branch (A+),\" while a score up to 500 is considered \"Poor (D)\". \u003cbr\u003e Reporting and Follow-Up \u003cbr\u003e An RBIA inspection includes a formalization meeting at the branch\u0027s conclusion, attended by the Branch Head and a representative from the Regional Office. A \u003cbr\u003e Formalization-cum-Synopsis Letter is signed, highlighting major areas requiring urgent attention. The bank uses various special letters for reporting serious issues: \u003cbr\u003e SOL (Special Observation Letter): Used for very serious irregularities like misuse of discretionary powers or misappropriation of funds. An Inspecting Officer immediately informs the Head Office, which may issue an SOL. The branch must submit compliance within 15 days. \u003cbr\u003e Special Letter: For serious irregularities that are not severe enough to warrant an SOL. It requires a compliance report from the branch within 15 days. \u003cbr\u003e SOL DNR (Documents Not Renewed): Used to prompt the renewal of documents. The Inspecting Officer reports the status to the Head Office, which issues an SOL. The Head Office closes SOL DNRs with more than 24 pending documents, while the Regional Office closes those with up to 24. \u003cbr\u003e Branches must submit a Clean Rectification Certificate (CRC) within 60 days of receiving the inspection report. If full rectification is not possible, a \u003cbr\u003e Qualified Rectification Certificate (QRC) can be submitted, and the Regional Office may grant up to an additional 60 days (for a total of 120 days). \u003cbr\u003e Corrective Actions and Ethics \u003cbr\u003e Based on audit findings, the bank may implement various corrective actions, such as changing the branch leadership, withholding delegated powers, or introducing concurrent audits. These are illustrative steps, and the actual measures may vary. \u003cbr\u003e Auditors are expected to follow a Code of Ethics based on the principles of integrity, objectivity, confidentiality, and competency. They must maintain audit evidence and working papers for a required period. The policy is owned by the General Manager (Audit \u0026 Inspection) and is reviewed and approved by the Board. It remains in force for three years from the date of approval. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e According to the document, which entity is the third line of defense in the bank\u0027s risk management model? \u003cbr\u003e Operations / Business UnitsB.

It defines the scope of the audit, the branches and departments to be covered, and the items to be checked. The policy also details the procedures for appointing both Chartered Accountant (CA) firms and retired bank officers as concurrent auditors, including their remuneration, accountability, and attendance requirements. \u003cbr\u003e Scope and Purpose of Concurrent Audit \u003cbr\u003e Concurrent audit is a real-time examination of transactions, aiming to minimize the time lag between a transaction\u0027s occurrence and its scrutiny by an independent party. Unlike traditional audits that rely on test-checking, this process emphasizes substantive checking in key areas. It serves as a management tool to establish sound internal accounting and control functions, helping to prevent and detect serious errors and fraudulent manipulations promptly. \u003cbr\u003e A concurrent auditor\u0027s role is not to judge the decisions of a Branch Manager but to ensure that transactions and decisions adhere to the bank\u0027s policies, instructions, and delegated authority. The auditor is an independent agency that provides on-the-spot examination and administrative support to branches. A key objective is the timely rectification of errors and irregularities, ensuring they don\u0027t recur. The auditor is expected to report any deviations from established rules that could lead to irregularities. \u003cbr\u003e Coverage of Business and Branches \u003cbr\u003e The concurrent audit covers departments at the Head Office that handle treasury functions like investments, funds management, and bill rediscounting. Additionally, all branches and dealing rooms involved in such business must be continuously audited. \u003cbr\u003e To ensure adequate coverage, the audit must encompass branches that meet two main criteria, each covering at least 50% of the bank\u0027s totals: \u003cbr\u003e Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures make up at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total. \u003cbr\u003e Branches whose aggregate deposits cover at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total deposits. \u003cbr\u003e To achieve these criteria, branches are selected in descending order of their credit and risk exposures to meet the first 50% threshold. If these branches don\u0027t also cover 50% of deposits, additional branches are added, starting with those with the highest deposits, until the deposit threshold is met. \u003cbr\u003e Other branches and departments that must be included are the main branch, other larger branches, branches rated as poor/very poor in internal audits, and any other branches or departments deemed to require a concurrent audit by the bank. Branches under concurrent audit are typically not included for revenue/income audits. \u003cbr\u003e Items of Coverage \u003cbr\u003e The concurrent auditor must verify that all prescribed systems and procedures are meticulously followed at the branch. A key focus is on voucher audits to confirm the authenticity and accuracy of transactions and the delegated authority of the official who executed them. Any serious discrepancies must be reported to higher authorities immediately. \u003cbr\u003e The main areas of coverage, which are detailed in the audit report format, include but are not limited to: \u003cbr\u003e Cash management. \u003cbr\u003e ","title":"AUDIT \u0026 INSPECTION","id":18},{"content":"KYC compliance. \u003cbr\u003e Opening and closing of accounts and modifications. \u003cbr\u003e Deposits and advances. \u003cbr\u003e Issuance of chequebooks. \u003cbr\u003e Remittances and clearing operations. \u003cbr\u003e Credit/advances including application documents, credit appraisal, and legal compliance. \u003cbr\u003e NPA management. \u003cbr\u003e Para-banking activities like safe deposit lockers and referral business. \u003cbr\u003e Statutory compliances and internal controls. \u003cbr\u003e The scope of the audit is not limited to these points and may include additional aspects depending on the branch\u0027s nature of business. \u003cbr\u003e Appointment and Remuneration of Auditors \u003cbr\u003e The bank may engage both Chartered Accountant (CA) firms and its own retired officers for concurrent audit. \u003cbr\u003e CA Firms: They are appointed for an initial term of three years, subject to an annual performance review. After three years, their services may be continued based on satisfactory performance, and they are required to reapply. The bank will allot 2 to 3 branches annually to each firm. After a three-year assignment, there is a mandatory cooling period of at least one year. \u003cbr\u003e Retired Bank Officers: They can be appointed for concurrent audit if they meet specific criteria, including being at least a Grade/Scale III officer with at least three years of experience as a Branch Manager and knowledge of the finacle system. They are eligible for the work during the first five years after their retirement and up to the age of 65. The bank can consider officers over 65 on a case-by-case basis based on their physical/medical fitness. Disqualifications include compulsory retirement, removal from service, or dismissal. A selection committee, headed by the General Manager, interviews willing retired officers and puts forward a list of selected candidates to the Chairman for final approval. The appointment is initially for one year and can be extended based on performance. \u003cbr\u003e The policy specifies the allocation of branches between the two types of auditors. For branches selected for concurrent audit, 60% of the total business should be covered by CA firms and the remaining 40% by retired officers. \u003cbr\u003e Remuneration for concurrent auditors varies based on the branch\u0027s loan outstanding: \u003cbr\u003e Loan outstanding up to Rs. 10 crore: Rs. 8,000 per branch per month. \u003cbr\u003e Loan outstanding over Rs. 10 crore and up to Rs. 20 crore: Rs. 9,000 per branch per month. \u003cbr\u003e Loan outstanding over Rs. 20 crore and District Headquarter Branches: Rs. 10,000 per branch per month. \u003cbr\u003e Travel expenses are also provided, ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 2,000 per month, depending on the distance of the branch from the district headquarters. These payments are inclusive of all out-of- pocket and local travel expenses. \u003cbr\u003e Accountability and Reporting \u003cbr\u003e Concurrent auditors are responsible for any material omission or commission in their work. The bank can terminate an auditor\u0027s engagement at any time if a serious act of omission or commission is observed or if the performance or quality of the report is not up to the mark. \u003cbr\u003e An auditor must visit the branch at least five times a month. They must sign an attendance register at the branch and mark their attendance on a Google Sheet. The monthly report must be submitted by the 7th day of the following month. Payment is made monthly by the Regional Office only after the report and attendance sheet are received. The Chairman or General Manager is authorized to assign work and debar any auditor whose performance is found to be unsatisfactory. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions \u003cbr\u003e What is the primary objective of a concurrent audit, as per the policy document? \u003cbr\u003e To punish branch officials for errors. \u003cbr\u003e To replace the Branch Manager\u0027s decision-making authority. \u003cbr\u003e To conduct an examination of transactions as close to their occurrence as possible. \u003cbr\u003e To perform a revenue/income audit of all bank branches. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) To conduct an examination of transactions as close to their occurrence as possible.Correct Answer: c) To conduct an examination of transactions as close to their occurrence as possible. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) To conduct an examination of transactions as close to their occurrence as possible. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) To conduct an examination of transactions as close to their occurrence as possible. \u003cbr\u003e Which of the following is a criterion for selecting branches for concurrent audit? \u003cbr\u003e Branches with a loan outstanding of more than Rs. 50 crore. \u003cbr\u003e Branches with a large number of female employees. \u003cbr\u003e Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures are at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total. \u003cbr\u003e Branches with the newest technology. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures are at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total.Correct Answer: c) Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures are at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures are at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Branches whose total credit and other risk exposures are at least 50% of the bank\u0027s total. \u003cbr\u003e For a retired bank officer to be eligible for concurrent audit work, what is the minimum grade/scale they must have held? \u003cbr\u003e Scale Ib) Scale IIc) Scale IIId) Scale IV \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Scale III \u003cbr\u003e What is the minimum number of times a concurrent auditor must visit a branch in a month? \u003cbr\u003e Onceb) Three timesc) Five timesd) Ten times \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Five times \u003cbr\u003e For branches with a loan outstanding of more than Rs. 20 crore, what is the monthly remuneration for a concurrent auditor? \u003cbr\u003e Rs. 8,000b) Rs. 9,000c) Rs. 10,000d) Rs. 15,000 \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) Rs. 10,000 \u003cbr\u003e How long is the initial appointment period for a Chartered Accountant firm for concurrent audit? \u003cbr\u003e 1 yearb) 2 yearsc) 3 yearsd) 5 years \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: c) 3 years \u003cbr\u003e What is the reporting deadline for the monthly Concurrent Audit report? \u003cbr\u003e By the 1st day of the next month. \u003cbr\u003e By the 7th day of the next month. \u003cbr\u003e By the 15th day of the next month. \u003cbr\u003e By the last day of the next month. \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: b) By the 7th day of the next month. \u003cbr\u003e What percentage of the total business of identified branches should be covered by Chartered Accountant (CA) firms? \u003cbr\u003e 20%b) 40%c) 50%d) 60% \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: d) 60% \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 3: Revenue Audit Policy \u003cbr\u003e A revenue audit is a process that examines whether a bank branch has correctly and timely collected all eligible fees and charges. The audit\u0027s main objective is to detect and recover income leakages that can negatively impact the bank\u0027s profitability. \u003cbr\u003e Scope and Purpose \u003cbr\u003e The Revenue Audit is a key tool for detecting revenue leakage and ensuring the timely collection of revenue for the bank. Branches with large credit and deposit portfolios may not be able to recover all eligible charges and fees in a timely manner due to the high volume of transactions, which leads to income leakage and adversely affects the bank\u0027s profitability. \u003cbr\u003e Items Covered in a Revenue Audit \u003cbr\u003e The audit covers a variety of areas to ensure all applicable charges and fees are levied. These include: \u003cbr\u003e Deposit Accounts: All applicable interest, charges, and fees must be applied. \u003cbr\u003e Fresh Advances/Renewal/Review of Advance Accounts: All applicable interest, charges, and fees must be charged. \u003cbr\u003e Non-Fund Based Business: This includes accounts for services like Letters of Credit (LC) and Bank Guarantees. \u003cbr\u003e Locker Facility: Applicable charges must be levied for providing locker facilities. \u003cbr\u003e Other Charges: Any other applicable charges or fees must be levied in their respective accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Branch Identification and Periodicity \u003cbr\u003e The Head Office identifies branches for audit based on several parameters. These include: \u003cbr\u003e Branches with a high volume of deposits and credit portfolios. \u003cbr\u003e District Head Quarter or Main Branches of every district. \u003cbr\u003e Any other abnormal features discovered through data analysis. \u003cbr\u003e The revenue audit is conducted on a half-yearly basis by an Inspecting Officer designated by the Head Office. \u003cbr\u003e Compliance and Closure \u003cbr\u003e After the audit, the Inspecting Officer submits a detailed report to the Head Office, which then forwards it to the concerned Regional Office for the branch to act on. To ensure revenue leakage is recovered as soon as possible, the Inspecting Officer should aim for spot recovery to the maximum extent possible. The Regional Office must ensure compliance with the report within 15 days and submit a compliance certificate with its recommendations to the Head Office for closure. \u003cbr\u003e If the total revenue leakage found in an audit or inspection at a branch surpasses 0.50 lakh, an explanation must be sought from the staff members involved. In such cases, staff accountability should also be examined if necessary. The bank will report its progress to the Audit Committee of the Board for review and further instructions. \u003cbr\u003e Policy Validity and Authority \u003cbr\u003e The Chairman or General Manager is authorized to issue additional administrative guidelines for the Revenue Audit System whenever needed. This policy is valid for three years from the approval date, after which it will be reviewed and revised as required. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions \u0026 Answers Question 1: What is the primary purpose of a revenue audit? \u003cbr\u003e To assess staff performance. \u003cbr\u003e To check for compliance with applicable charges and fees. \u003cbr\u003e To identify and correct operational inefficiencies. \u003cbr\u003e To prepare the bank\u0027s annual financial statements. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) To check for compliance with applicable charges and fees. \u003cbr\u003e Question 2: Which of the following is NOT a parameter for identifying branches for a revenue audit? \u003cbr\u003e Branches with high deposit and credit portfolios. \u003cbr\u003e District Head Quarter branches. \u003cbr\u003e Branches with the highest number of customer complaints. \u003cbr\u003e Branches showing abnormal features from data analysis. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Branches with the highest number of customer complaints. \u003cbr\u003e Question 3: How often is a revenue audit conducted? \u003cbr\u003e Quarterly.B) Annually.C) Half-yearlyD) Monthly. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Half-yearly. \u003cbr\u003e Question 4: What is the maximum timeframe for a Regional Office to ensure compliance with a revenue audit report? \u003cbr\u003e 7 days.B) 15 days.C) 30 days.D) 45 days. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) 15 days. \u003cbr\u003e Question 5: At what threshold of cumulative revenue leakage must an explanation be sought from the concerned staff? \u003cbr\u003e Exceeding 0.25 lakh.B) Exceeding 0.50 lakh. \u003cbr\u003e C) Exceeding 1.00 lakh.D) Exceeding 5.00 lakh. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Exceeding 0.50 lakh. \u003cbr\u003e Question 6: Who is authorized to issue additional administrative guidelines for the Revenue Audit System? \u003cbr\u003e A) The Inspecting Officer.B) The Regional Manager. \u003cbr\u003e C) The Head Office Audit Department.D) The Chairman or General Manager. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: D) The Chairman or General Manager. \u003cbr\u003e Question 7: How long is the Revenue Audit Policy valid before it needs to be reviewed? \u003cbr\u003e One year.B) Two years.C) Three years.D) Four years. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Three years. \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 4: Policy Guidelines for a Special Audit System \u003cbr\u003e This chapter outlines the formal procedure for conducting special audits of any bank branch.

The primary objectives include reviewing the sanction process for large loans, providing feedback on regulatory compliance, independently reviewing credit risk, identifying early warning signals, and recommending corrective measures. \u003cbr\u003e Accounts covered under Credit Audit are: \u003cbr\u003e All fresh sanctions or limit increases (Fund-based and Non-Funded) of â‚¹10.00 lakh and above \u003cbr\u003e within a quarter. \u003cbr\u003e All reviews with an increase of â‚¹10.00 lakh and above within a quarter. \u003cbr\u003e All reviews of existing accounts with sanctioned limits of â‚¹25.00 lakh and above within a quarter. \u003cbr\u003e Accounts with limits between â‚¹10.00 lakh and â‚¹25.00 lakh are audited once and then \u003cbr\u003e excluded from subsequent audits. \u003cbr\u003e Certain loans like staff loans, loans against NSC/KVP/LIC, and LABOD with an outstanding \u003cbr\u003e balance below â‚¹10.00 lakh are excluded. \u003cbr\u003e Credit audits for eligible accounts must be completed within \u003cbr\u003e 3 to 6 months of the sanction or review date. Housing and education loan accounts are audited within one year of disbursement or project completion, whichever is earlier. The credit auditor discusses findings with the branch head but is not required to visit the borrower\u0027s premises. All NPA \u003cbr\u003e accounts are excluded from credit audits. Regional Offices are responsible for ensuring rectification of discrepancies and submitting a Rectification Certificate to the Head Office within 15 days of receiving the report. \u003cbr\u003e Legal Audit \u003cbr\u003e Legal audit is mandated by the RBI to ensure the genuineness of title deeds and other loan-related documents. It is applicable to all credit exposures of \u003cbr\u003e â‚¹1.00 crore and above. \u003cbr\u003e Periodicity of Legal Audit: \u003cbr\u003e Loans of â‚¹1 crore and above up to â‚¹5 crores: Once every 3 years. \u003cbr\u003e Loans above â‚¹5 crores: Once every 2 years. \u003cbr\u003e Mortgage-based retail loan accounts with an outstanding balance of â‚¹10 lakhs and above \u003cbr\u003e must undergo legal vetting every 5 years. \u003cbr\u003e The bank\u0027s legal audit procedure involves several steps: \u003cbr\u003e A Title Search Report (TSR) is obtained from a panel advocate to verify legal ownership and check for defects or encumbrances. The advocate must search records for at least 30 years and certify that the title is clear and marketable. All communication with the advocate should be handled by the bank, not the customer. \u003cbr\u003e After loan documents are executed, a legal vetting is performed by an advocate or law officer to ensure they are valid and enforceable. This vetting includes checking for proper stamp duty, ensuring all blanks are filled, and verifying that the documents align with the sanction terms. The advocate for vetting must be different from the one who provided the TSR. \u003cbr\u003e The Legal Audit Compliance (LAC) exercise is a periodic re-verification of title deeds and security documents until the loan is fully repaid. The purpose is to ensure the bank\u0027s interests are protected and to correct any deficiencies. A legal audit report must be submitted in a prescribed format. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e What is the minimum loan amount for a credit audit to be conducted on a fresh sanction? \u003cbr\u003e â‚¹25.00 lakhB) â‚¹5.00 lakhC) â‚¹10.00 lakhD) â‚¹1.00 crore \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: C) â‚¹10.00 lakh \u003cbr\u003e How often must a legal audit be performed on a credit exposure of â‚¹1 crore and above up to â‚¹5 \u003cbr\u003e crores? \u003cbr\u003e Once every 2 yearsB) Once every 3 yearsC) AnnuallyD) Only at the time of sanction \u003cbr\u003e Correct Answer: B) Once every 3 years \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 7: Stock Audit \u003cbr\u003e A Stock Audit is conducted for large borrower accounts to verify the existence, condition, and valuation of stocks and book debts. \u003cbr\u003e Applicability: \u003cbr\u003e Annual Stock Audit is mandatory for all borrower accounts with Fund-Based and Non- Funded working capital limits of â‚¹100 lakhs and above from the bank. \u003cbr\u003e For accounts with limits under â‚¹100 lakhs, a stock audit can be done in emergent cases with \u003cbr\u003e the Regional Manager\u0027s concurrence. \u003cbr\u003e In consortium or multiple banking arrangements, the bank should coordinate with the lead bank to ensure a stock audit is conducted if the aggregate limit is â‚¹100 lakhs or more. \u003cbr\u003e Stock Auditors: \u003cbr\u003e The bank maintains a panel of reputable Chartered Accountants or firms with at least five years of standing and at least one partner who is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (FCA). \u003cbr\u003e The panel is approved by the General Manager, Credit, and is valid for a period of three years.

These norms were introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) based on the recommendations of the Committee on the Financial System, chaired by Shri M. Narasimham. The primary purpose is to ensure greater consistency and transparency in the published accounts of banks and to make them more sensitive to credit risks. Banks must effectively and efficiently manage Nonâ€Performing Assets \u003cbr\u003e (NPAs) to sustain profitability. Branches are advised to be proactive and alert in monitoring advances, using systemâ€generated data to identify and address potential defaults in standard accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Early Alert System \u003cbr\u003e The RBI has provided guidelines to prevent loan accounts from slipping into NPA status by \u003cbr\u003e recognizing early warning signals. Banks have established an \"Early Alert System\" to capture these \u003cbr\u003e signals through the analysis of system data, credit ratings, and credit monitoring. This system helps in the early identification and reporting of stressed assets. \u003cbr\u003e Loan accounts showing incipient stress are classified as Special Mention Accounts (SMA). This classification is based on the period for which the principal or interest payment, or any other amount, is overdue. \u003cbr\u003e SMA-0: Overdue for up to 30 days. \u003cbr\u003e SMA-1: Overdue for more than 30 days and up to 60 days. \u003cbr\u003e SMA-2: Overdue for more than 60 days and up to 90 days. \u003cbr\u003e For revolving credit facilities like cash credit or overdrafts, the SMA subâ€categories are based on how long the outstanding balance remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing power. \u003cbr\u003e SMA-1: Exceeds limit for more than 30 days and up to 60 days. \u003cbr\u003e SMA-2: Exceeds limit for more than 60 days and up to 90 days. \u003cbr\u003e These SMA classification norms apply to all loans, including retail loans, with the exception of agricultural advances that are governed by crop seasonâ€based norms. \u003cbr\u003e Potential NPA \u003cbr\u003e An account is considered a Potential NPA if it shows signs of becoming an NPA. These signs are illustrative and include, but are not limited to: \u003cbr\u003e Nonâ€payment of interest or principal installments by the due date. \u003cbr\u003e The unit showing signs of sickness. \u003cbr\u003e Reduction in turnover or sales in the account. \u003cbr\u003e Closure of the unit due to strikes or court orders. \u003cbr\u003e The death of the borrower or a natural calamity. \u003cbr\u003e A delay in payment of principal or interest beyond a reasonable period will classify an account as a Potential NPA. The ability of the borrower to service the account is the key determinant for this \u003cbr\u003e classification. When an account becomes overdue or is classified as a Potential NPA, branches are required to send notices to the borrower and guarantors, detailing potential legal and recovery measures that could be initiated if the account turns into an NPA. \u003cbr\u003e Asset Classification \u003cbr\u003e The document provides a detailed classification of loan assets based on their performance. \u003cbr\u003e Standard Assets: These are accounts where the payment of interest and installments is regular. They are considered to have no problems and are continuously monitored to ensure compliance with all terms and conditions of the loan. An amount is considered \u003cbr\u003e \u0027Overdue\u0027 if it is not paid on the fixed due date. \u003cbr\u003e Non-Performing Assets (NPA): An asset becomes nonâ€performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank. A loan or advance is classified as an NPA under the following conditions: \u003cbr\u003e Term Loans: Interest and/or principal installments remain overdue for more than 90 days. \u003cbr\u003e Overdraft/Cash Credit (OD/CC): The account is \"out of order\" for any of these reasons: \u003cbr\u003e The outstanding balance continuously exceeds the sanctioned limit or drawing power for 90 days. \u003cbr\u003e The outstanding balance is less than the limit, but there have been no credits for 90 continuous days. \u003cbr\u003e The outstanding balance is less than the limit, but credits are insufficient to cover the interest debited during the previous 90â€day period. \u003cbr\u003e Bills Purchased and Discounted: The bill remains overdue for more than 90 days. \u003cbr\u003e Credit Card Accounts: The minimum amount due is not paid in full within 90 days from the payment due date. \u003cbr\u003e Agricultural Advances: The NPA classification for these loans is based on crop seasons. \u003cbr\u003e Short Duration Crops: A loan is an NPA if the installment of principal or interest is overdue for two crop seasons. \u003cbr\u003e Long Duration Crops: A loan is an NPA if the installment of principal or interest is overdue for one crop season. \u003cbr\u003e The crop season is determined by the State Level Bankers\u0027 Committee (SLBC). These norms apply to specific agricultural activities, including crop loans, medium and longâ€term loans for agriculture, loans for pre and postâ€harvest activities, loans against agricultural produce, loans to distressed farmers, Kisan Credit Card schemes, and loans for land purchase. Other agricultural loans not specified are classified as NPAs based on the 90â€day delinquency norm. \u003cbr\u003e In cases of natural calamities, relief measures such as conversion of shortâ€term loans into term loans or rescheduling of repayment are permitted. Such converted or rescheduled loans are not immediately classified as NPAs and their asset classification is governed by the new terms. \u003cbr\u003e Other Classifications: \u003cbr\u003e Security Value: The availability of security or net worth of the borrower/guarantor should not be considered for NPA classification, except in cases of serious credit impairment. If the realizable value of the security is less than 50% of the assessed value, the account is classified as Doubtful. If the realizable value is less than 10%, the account is classified as a Loss Asset. \u003cbr\u003e Temporary Deficiencies: Working capital accounts with irregular drawings for a continuous period of 90 days will be classified as NPA, even if the unit is functional or the borrower\u0027s financial position is satisfactory. An account is also treated as an NPA if regular or ad hoc \u003cbr\u003e credit limits are not reviewed or renewed within 180 days. \u003cbr\u003e Consortium Lending: In consortium lending, the asset classification for each member bank is based on its own recovery record. An account will be treated as an NPA for a member bank if the borrower\u0027s remittances are not shared by the receiving bank. \u003cbr\u003e Advances against Specific Securities: Advances against term deposits, NSCs, KVPs, and life insurance policies are not treated as NPAs if an adequate margin is available. \u003cbr\u003e NPA Upgradation: An NPA account can be upgraded to a \u0027standard\u0027 asset only after the borrower pays the entire arrears of interest and principal. If a borrower has multiple credit facilities, all must be cleared for any account to be upgraded. \u003cbr\u003e Asset Classification - Borrower-wise: All credit facilities granted to a single borrower must be treated as NPA if one facility becomes irregular; it is not facilityâ€specific. \u003cbr\u003e Income Recognition \u003cbr\u003e Income recognition must be objective and based on the record of recovery. Banks should not recognize income from interest on any NPA. This also applies to governmentâ€guaranteed accounts. However, interest on advances against certain securities like term deposits and NSCs can be taken to the income account on the due date, provided there is an adequate margin. Fees and commissions from debt rescheduling should be recognized on an accrual basis. \u003cbr\u003e When an advance becomes an NPA, any accrued interest that has not been realized must be reversed. Further application of interest to the account should be stopped, although banks may record it in a memorandum account for their records. \u003cbr\u003e Asset Classification for Restructured Loans \u003cbr\u003e When a standard account is restructured, it is immediately downgraded to a sub-standard asset. If an NPA is restructured, it retains its original asset classification. The classification is also subject to the \u003cbr\u003e ageing criteria. \u003cbr\u003e For MSME accounts with an aggregate exposure of less than â‚¹25 crore, an account can be upgraded to \u0027standard\u0027 if it shows \"satisfactory performance\" during a \"specified period\". \u003cbr\u003e Specified Period: One year from the commencement of the first payment of interest or principal. \u003cbr\u003e Satisfactory Performance: No payment (interest and/or principal) remains overdue for more than 30 days. For cash credit/overdraft accounts, the outstanding balance must not exceed \u003cbr\u003e the sanctioned limit or drawing power for more than 30 days. \u003cbr\u003e For all other accounts, upgrade to \u0027standard\u0027 requires a period of \"satisfactory performance\" during the monitoring period, which involves the repayment of at least 10% of the sum of outstanding principal debt. An additional provision of 15% is made for such accounts that fail to demonstrate satisfactory performance. \u003cbr\u003e Categorization of NPAs \u003cbr\u003e NPAs are further categorized based on their duration and recoverability. \u003cbr\u003e Sub-standard Assets: An asset that has remained an NPA for a period of up to 12 months. \u003cbr\u003e Doubtful Assets: An asset that has remained in the subâ€standard category for 12 months.

It is a nonâ€legal remedy used to reduce Nonâ€Performing Assets (NPAs). This type of settlement might involve the bank sacrificing a portion of the amount due from the borrower and waiving its claims to that extent. The agreement is reached through mutual consent. \u003cbr\u003e When a loan account becomes an NPA and attempts to make it performing again fail, the bank must recall the account and initiate recovery steps. While the bank\u0027s normal goal is to recover all dues, including unapplied interest and costs, without any sacrifice, there are situations where waiving \u003cbr\u003e some interest or legal charges and accepting a lesser amount is considered. The difference between \u003cbr\u003e the total amount owed and the final agreedâ€upon settlement amount is the \u0027sacrifice\u0027 the bank bears, which can be in the form of a writeâ€off or waiver. \u003cbr\u003e When to Consider a Compromise Settlement \u003cbr\u003e Compromise proposals are typically considered in the following situations: \u003cbr\u003e Lump-sum payment: When the borrower is willing to settle the dues in a lump sum, and the bank\u0027s sacrifice is minimal, considering the time and value of money involved in a lengthy legal recovery process. \u003cbr\u003e Cost-benefit analysis: When the bank anticipates that the time and cost of a lawsuit and executing a decree will be greater than the potential recovery. \u003cbr\u003e Unviable business: When a business unit has become unviable due to chronic issues with production or sales, and the borrower\u0027s or guarantor\u0027s resources and securities are insufficient. \u003cbr\u003e Lack of security: When there is no security available, or its realization is difficult, the unit is closed, there are no assets for a decree\u0027s execution, and the borrower or guarantor is willing to settle out of court. \u003cbr\u003e When Not to Consider a Compromise Settlement for a Lower Amount \u003cbr\u003e A compromise for a lower amount should generally not be pursued in these cases: \u003cbr\u003e Adequate realizable securities: When there are sufficient, marketable securities and charged property available to cover the bank\u0027s dues. \u003cbr\u003e Guarantee cover: When accounts are covered by a guarantee from entities like CGTMSE, and adequate securities or the current net worth of the borrower or guarantor is sufficient to cover the dues. \u003cbr\u003e Ageing of Exposure for Coverage \u003cbr\u003e Compromise settlements are applicable to NPA accounts that have been in this category for more than six months and where all other recovery measures have been exhausted. Such accounts can be considered for settlement on a caseâ€byâ€case basis. Special oneâ€time settlement (OTS) schemes announced by the RBI or the bank, such as those for SMEs or small borrowers, are outside the purview of this policy and have their own specific guidelines. \u003cbr\u003e Basic Principles Governing Compromise Settlements \u003cbr\u003e The primary objective is to maximize recovery from a distressed borrower with minimal expense, serving the best interests of the bank. Key principles include: \u003cbr\u003e Negotiated settlement: The process is a negotiated settlement aimed at recovering the maximum possible amount in the shortest time frame. \u003cbr\u003e Opportunity cost analysis: The bank should weigh the advantage of promptly recycling funds from a compromise settlement against the likely recovery from a long legal process. \u003cbr\u003e Distinction between defaulters: A distinction should be made between \"wilful defaulters\" and \"defaulters due to circumstances beyond their control\". A tough stance should be taken with wilful defaulters, while a sympathetic view can be adopted for the latter. \u003cbr\u003e Accountability: The assessment of staff accountability for an account\u0027s slippage to NPA status must be adhered to and included in the compromise proposal. \u003cbr\u003e KYC update: As much as possible, KYC details like PAN and Aadhaar should be updated to facilitate reporting the settlement to Credit Information Companies (CICs). \u003cbr\u003e Guiding Factors in Compromise Negotiation \u003cbr\u003e Several factors must be considered during negotiation: \u003cbr\u003e Total Contractual Dues: This includes the sum of all outstanding balances in the borrower\u0027s various accounts, unapplied interest, and legal expenses. Negotiation should begin with these gross dues. \u003cbr\u003e Net Book Dues: This is the outstanding balance in the borrower\u0027s accounts, reduced by any margin money, time deposits, or claims received from guarantee schemes like CGTMSE. \u003cbr\u003e Details and Realizable Value of Securities: Details of movable and immovable assets must be considered. The realizable value of securities is a crucial factor. The valuation should be conducted by an approved valuer and should not be more than one year old. If securities are adequate and easily realizable, the sacrifice should be minimal. The marketability of securities, especially with legal issues like pending litigation, tenancy rights, or tribal land laws, is a key consideration. \u003cbr\u003e Reasons for Business Failure: The cause of the business failure, whether due to a change in government policy or willful mismanagement, should be taken into account. \u003cbr\u003e Present Status of the Unit: If the unit is still operational with good prospects, rehabilitation might be considered. If it\u0027s closed, a compromise for maximum recovery is preferable. \u003cbr\u003e Means of Borrowers/Guarantors: Their current worth and means have a bearing on the settlement. \u003cbr\u003e Amount and Mode of Payment: The bank aims for the maximum amount in the shortest time. The core principle is minimum sacrifice. A reasonable interest rate, at least covering the cost of funds, should be negotiated. \u003cbr\u003e Period of Recovery: The settlement is typically negotiated for a bullet payment within 30 days. Depending on circumstances, it can be extended up to 90 days, but any claims recognized on the balance sheet for this period will be treated as restructuring. For larger proposals, up to 12 months may be allowed with a down payment of at least 15% and interest on the remaining amount. Settlements exceeding three months are classified as restructuring. \u003cbr\u003e Recovery of Interest: For settlements with extended payment periods, a suitable interest rate (not less than 12% per annum) should be applied to prompt timely repayment. If the compromise amount is not paid as per the terms, the settlement is deemed void, and a new proposal may be considered. \u003cbr\u003e Specifics and Legal Aspects \u003cbr\u003e CGTMSE and other Guarantee Coverage: When accounts are covered by CGTMSE, the trust\u0027s guidelines must be followed. Legal action must be initiated to claim the guarantee, even with \u003cbr\u003e an OTS, unless the outstanding amount is below a specified threshold, such as Rs. 10,00,000 as per recent guidelines. \u003cbr\u003e Limitation: For nonâ€suit filed accounts, documents should be kept alive by obtaining a Letter of Acknowledgement of Debt (LAD) from borrowers. \u003cbr\u003e Suit-Filed Accounts: For sanctioned compromises, consent terms with a default clause must be filed with the court or DRT. This default clause should state that if the borrower fails to pay, the original contractual dues, interest, and costs are recoverable. \u003cbr\u003e Staff Accountability: The status of staff accountability should be examined when an account becomes an NPA and mentioned in the compromise proposal, along with any proposed or taken action against erring officials. \u003cbr\u003e Reporting: The bank must report to CIBIL and other credit information companies that the \"Account has been settled through compromise\". \u003cbr\u003e Compromise Settlements in Cases of Fraud \u003cbr\u003e Board Approval: Proposals for compromise settlements with individuals classified as fraud or wilful defaulters require approval from the Board in all cases. \u003cbr\u003e Separate Proceedings: It must be made clear to the borrower that the compromise \u003cbr\u003e settlement relates only to the recovery of civil liabilities and does not affect any ongoing criminal action for fraud. \u003cbr\u003e No Withdrawal of Criminal Case: The bank must not withdraw the criminal case after a \u003cbr\u003e settlement. The file should be kept securely until the criminal proceedings are concluded. \u003cbr\u003e Consent Orders: When a consent order is obtained from a court or DRT, a specific clause must be included stating that the settlement does not affect criminal proceedings. \u003cbr\u003e Informing Authorities: The bank should inform the CBI or other investigating agencies of its intention to settle the civil dues and may wait for a response or objections for a reasonable period, such as 30 days. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e What is a compromise settlement defined as in the document?

It details the delegation of powers, the structure of settlement advisory committees, special considerations for certain types of accounts, and other related guidelines. \u003cbr\u003e Delegation of Powers \u003cbr\u003e To facilitate recovery through compromise, discretionary powers are delegated to various authorities to sanction sacrifices, which include waiver and writeâ€off. The primary principle governing this delegation is that the approving authority (either an individual or a committee) must be at least one level higher in the hierarchy than the authority that originally sanctioned the credit or investment exposure. A crucial provision is that any official who was part of the original loan sanctioning process, either individually or as part of a committee, cannot be part of the committee approving the compromise settlement for the same loan account. \u003cbr\u003e The document provides a specific table detailing the powers for sacrifice (waiver plus writeâ€off) in Lakhs of Rupees for different authorities and their respective Settlement Advisory Committees (SAC). \u003cbr\u003e Chairman (HO SAC-I): â‚¹40.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e General Manager (HO SAC-II): â‚¹25.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e General Manager (HO SAC-III): â‚¹20.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e Regional Manager Scale-V (RO SAC-I): â‚¹15.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e Regional Manager Scale-IV (RO SAC-II): â‚¹10.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e Chief Manager (RO SAC-III): â‚¹5.00 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e Chief Manager as Branch Head (BR SAC-I): â‚¹2.50 Lakhs \u003cbr\u003e Sr. Manager at R.O. / Sr. Manager as Branch Head (RO SAC-IV / BR SAC-II): â‚¹2.00 Lakhs and \u003cbr\u003e â‚¹1.50 Lakhs, respectively \u003cbr\u003e Branch Manager Scale II (BR SAC-III): â‚¹1.00 Lakh \u003cbr\u003e Proposals for compromise settlements for debtors classified as fraud or wilful defaulters require Board approval in all cases. Any compromise proposal that falls outside the delegated powers must be sanctioned by a \u0027Member committee of Board\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e All sanctioned compromise or OTS cases must be reported by the sanctioning authority to the next higher authority for \"PSR (Postâ€Sanction Review) noting\" on a caseâ€byâ€case basis. Proposals sanctioned by Regional Managers must be reported to the General Manager SAC at the Head Office for PSR noting. \u003cbr\u003e Settlement Advisory Committee (SAC) \u003cbr\u003e Bankâ€™s NPA management policy emphasizes a committee approach for sanctioning compromise \u003cbr\u003e settlements. Settlement Advisory Committees (SAC) are established at various levels, including the Head Office (HO) and Regional Office (RO). The document outlines the constitution, quorum, and convener for these committees at different levels of authority: \u003cbr\u003e For Chairman (HO SAC-I): The committee is headed by the Chairman and includes a General Manager,Inâ€chargeofrecoveryatHO,andInâ€chargeofCredit/Credit \u003cbr\u003e Monitoring/Operation/Inspection at HO. The quorum requires the Chairman, the convener, and any two other members. \u003cbr\u003e For General Manager (HOSAC-II \u0026 HOSAC-III): The committee is headed by a General Manager and includes the Inâ€charge of recovery at HO and the Inâ€charge of Credit/Credit Monitoring/Operation/Inspection at HO. The quorum requires the General Manager, the convener, and any two other members. \u003cbr\u003e For Regional Manager (ROSAC-I \u0026 ROSAC-II): The committee is headed by the Regional Manager and includes the Inâ€charge of Recovery at RO and an Officer/s looking after Credit/Credit Monitoring/Operation/Inspection, etc., at RO. The quorum requires the Regional Manager, the convener, and any two other members. \u003cbr\u003e For Chief Manager (ROSAC-III): The committee is headed by a Chief Manager posted at RO. The quorum requires the Chief Manager, the convener, and any one other member. \u003cbr\u003e For Senior Manager (ROSAC-IV): The committee is headed by a Senior Manager at RO. The quorum requires the Sr. Manager, the convener, and any one other member. \u003cbr\u003e For Branch Head of Chief Manager Scale-IV (BR SAC-I): The committee is headed by the Chief Manager (Branch Head) and includes an officer looking after Credit/Recovery and other officers posted at the branch. The quorum requires the Branch Head and the convener. \u003cbr\u003e For Branch Manager Scale III and II, where the officer strength may be less than two, a committee approach may not be practical. In such cases, the \"Four Eyes\" principle should be followed as far as possible. \u003cbr\u003e In case of the long leave or absence of a competent sanctioning authority, the matter must be escalated to a higherâ€level committee for sanction. \u003cbr\u003e Deviations and Deciding Level of Authority \u003cbr\u003e Any deviation from the terms of a sanctioned compromise proposal should generally be referred back to the original sanctioning authority. However, modifications to proposals sanctioned by the Member Committee of the Board can be approved by the Chairman, provided such deviations do not change the original terms except for the mode of repayment, total period, or total sacrifice (which should not be more than 20% of the original sanction). This is subject to reporting to the Board. \u003cbr\u003e The level of authority for sanctioning a compromise is determined based on the notional interest calculation. This interest is calculated at a simple rate of 8.5% p.a. or the contractual rate, whichever is less. This calculation is applied to the net book dues (total dues minus specific deposits and claims, plus legal expenses) from the date interest ceased until the date of the proposed full payment. For decreed accounts, if the awarded interest rate is less than 8.5%, the sacrifice calculation is based on the terms of the decree. \u003cbr\u003e Special Accounts \u003cbr\u003e Staff/Staff Related Loan \u0026 Staff Guaranteed Accounts: No compromise settlements for \u003cbr\u003e these types of accounts can be sanctioned below the level of the General Manager at the Head Office. Proposals must be routed through the Regional Office. \u003cbr\u003e Fraud Reported Cases: Proposals for compromise settlements for debtors classified as fraud or wilful defaulters require the approval of the Board in all cases. Such proposals must be \u003cbr\u003e submitted to the Head Office through the concerned Regional Office for consideration by the Member Committee of the Board. \u003cbr\u003e Suit Filed Accounts: Any settlement reached with a borrower in a suitâ€filed account requires obtaining a consent decree from the judicial authorities. The consent decree must include a default clause stating that if the borrower fails to pay, the contractual dues, along with \u003cbr\u003e interest, costs, and expenses, will be recoverable. \u003cbr\u003e Cooling Period and Fresh Exposures \u003cbr\u003e A minimum cooling period of 12 months is required before assuming fresh exposures to borrowers who have settled their dues through a compromise or settlement. The delegation of powers for fresh finance to such applicants is vested with the Regional Head and above, after the completion of this cooling period. If the compromise was sanctioned by the Regional Head, the power for fresh finance is vested with the committee headed by the General Manager at the Head Office. \u003cbr\u003e The cooling period can be waived if the applicant reimburses the sacrifice made by the bank (e.g., writeâ€off, waiver of interest). In such cases, the sanctioning power for fresh finance remains with the respective authority within their delegated powers. \u003cbr\u003e The document also specifies that additional facilities should not be granted to wilful defaulters. They are debarred from institutional finance for five years from the date their name is removed from the list of wilful defaulters. Similarly, borrowers classified as fraud are debarred from availing bank finance for five years from the date of full payment of the defrauded amount. \u003cbr\u003e Other Matters and Record Keeping \u003cbr\u003e Compromise proposals falling under Head Office powers must be recommended by the Regional Head. \u003cbr\u003e The sanction letter must contain all agreed terms and conditions and a default clause. \u003cbr\u003e The net worth of the borrower/guarantor, recent valuation details of their property, and justification for any wide downward variation in value must be incorporated into the proposal. The property valuation should be recent, preferably not older than one year, and done by an approved valuer with no direct or indirect interest. \u003cbr\u003e Justification must be provided if a CGTMSE/DICGC claim has not been received or is unavailable. If a claim has been received, the appropriation of the compromise amount must follow CGTMSE scheme guidelines. \u003cbr\u003e The bank uses an internal OTS portal for all compromise/settlement sanctions. Branches must maintain a compromise sanction register that tallies with the portal. \u003cbr\u003e In line with RBI guidelines, the Region must maintain caseâ€wise data on compromise settlements, including trends, breakups for fraud/wilful defaulter accounts, and grouping by amount, sanctioning authority, and business segment. This information is to be provided to the Head Office for reporting to the board. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e What is the minimum hierarchical requirement for an authority to approve a compromise settlement?

The directions serve as a framework for a transparent and nonâ€discriminatory process, ensuring that institutional finance is not extended to entities that have intentionally defaulted on their obligations. \u003cbr\u003e 1. Objectives and Applicability1. Objectives and Applicability \u003cbr\u003e 1. Objectives and Applicability \u003cbr\u003e 1. Objectives and Applicability \u003cbr\u003e The primary objective of these directions is to establish a nonâ€discriminatory and transparent procedure, following the principles of natural justice, for classifying a borrower as a wilful defaulter. \u003cbr\u003e The directions also aim to create a system for disseminating credit information about wilful \u003cbr\u003e defaulters to caution lenders and prevent them from providing further institutional finance to such individuals or entities. The restrictions on further financial accommodation apply to wilful defaulters. \u003cbr\u003e 2. Definitions2. Definitions \u003cbr\u003e 2. Definitions \u003cbr\u003e 2. Definitions \u003cbr\u003e Several key terms to provide clarity on the concepts discussed: \u003cbr\u003e Diversion of Funds: This includes using shortâ€term working capital for longâ€term purposes not specified in the credit sanction terms, creating assets different from those for which the credit was sanctioned, transferring funds to group entities without approval, routing funds through unapproved lenders, investing in other companies without approval, and a shortfall in fund deployment that remains unaccounted for. \u003cbr\u003e Identification Committee: This is a committee formed to identify a wilful defaulter. It consists of a chairperson (an officer not more than one rank below the chairman) and two senior officials as members (not more than two ranks below the chairperson). For example, a committee might include a General Manager as the chairperson and two Chief Managers from Credit and Audit \u0026 Inspection, with a Chief Manager from NPA Management \u0026 Recovery acting as the convener. \u003cbr\u003e Large Defaulter: This refers to a defaulter with an outstanding amount of â‚¹1 crore and above where a suit has been filed or the account has been classified as doubtful or a loss. The outstanding amount includes unapplied interest. \u003cbr\u003e Review Committee: This committee is constituted by a lender to review the proposal of the Identification Committee. It comprises the chairman of the institution as the chairperson and two nominated directors. Importantly, members of the Identification Committee cannot be part of the Review Committee. \u003cbr\u003e Wilful Default: A wilful default is deemed to have occurred when a borrower defaults on their repayment obligations and one or more of the following are true: they had the capacity to repay but did not, they diverted or siphoned off funds, they disposed of secured assets without the bank\u0027s approval, or they failed to infuse equity as committed despite having the ability to do so. For a guarantor, it occurs if they fail to honor the guarantee when invoked despite having the means, dispose of secured assets without approval, or fail to infuse equity as committed. \u003cbr\u003e Wilful Defaulter: A wilful defaulter is a borrower or guarantor who has committed a wilful default with an outstanding amount of â‚¹25 lakh or more. In the case of a company, this includes its promoters and directors. For other entities, it includes the persons in charge of and responsible for the management of the entity\u0027s affairs. \u003cbr\u003e Siphoning of Funds: This is defined as the use of funds availed through a credit facility for purposes unrelated to the borrower\u0027s operations. \u003cbr\u003e Director Identification Number (DIN): This is a unique number assigned to directors under the Companies Act, 2013. It should be included in the data submitted to Credit Information Companies to correctly identify directors and prevent the wrongful denial of credit to individuals with similar names. \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of Wilful Defaulters Mechanism for Identification and Classification \u003cbr\u003e The process for identifying and classifying a wilful defaulter is a structured, twoâ€tier mechanism involving the \u003cbr\u003e Identification Committee and the Review Committee. \u003cbr\u003e Identification Committee\u0027s Role: The Identification Committee examines the evidence of wilful default. If it is satisfied that a wilful default has occurred, it issues a showâ€cause notice to the concerned parties (borrower, guarantor, promoter, or director), giving them 21 days to respond. The bank must disclose all materials and information on which the notice is based. After considering the submissions, the committee may propose to the Review Committee that the individual or entity be classified as a wilful defaulter, providing written reasons. \u003cbr\u003e Review Committee\u0027s Role: The proposal from the Identification Committee, along with any written representation from the borrower, is considered by the Review Committee. The Review Committee provides an opportunity for a personal hearing. A lawyer is not permitted to represent the borrower in this inâ€house proceeding. The Review Committee passes a reasoned order, which is then communicated to the wilful defaulter. If the Identification Committee determines the party is not a wilful defaulter, the case is not referred to the Review Committee. \u003cbr\u003e Specifics for Directors and Regional Committees \u003cbr\u003e A nonâ€wholeâ€time director, independent director, or nominee director will not be considered a wilful defaulter unless it is conclusively proven that the default occurred with their consent or connivance, or they were aware of the default but did not object in the board meeting minutes. \u003cbr\u003e A Regional Identification Committee is tasked with investigating and identifying \"wilful default\" in all NPA accounts with outstanding amounts of â‚¹25 lakh and above. This committee must properly investigate the means and income resources of the parties and forward a recommendation to the Head Office \"Identification Committee\" within 15 days of the account being classified as NPA. \u003cbr\u003e Specific Measures Against Wilful Defaulters \u003cbr\u003e Several penal and preventive measures can be used against wilful defaulters: \u003cbr\u003e Criminal Proceedings: Banks can initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters under applicable laws. The removal of a name from the List of Wilful Defaulters (LWD) does not affect ongoing criminal proceedings. \u003cbr\u003e Publication of Photographs: The photographs of individuals classified as wilful defaulters, along with their details (name, address, account number, outstanding exposure, etc.), are to be published in two leading newspapers, one of which must be in the vernacular language. \u003cbr\u003e Penal Measures: \u003cbr\u003e No additional credit facility can be granted to a wilful defaulter or any associated entity. \u003cbr\u003e This restriction remains for one year after the name is removed from the LWD. \u003cbr\u003e No credit facility for new ventures can be granted for five years after the name is removed from the LWD. \u003cbr\u003e Wilful defaulters and associated entities are not eligible for credit facility restructuring. \u003cbr\u003e Associated entities are defined as subsidiary companies, joint ventures, or associate companies if the defaulter is a company. If the defaulter is a person, it includes all entities where they are a promoter, director, or in charge of management. \u003cbr\u003e Legal Action: Branches and regional offices are advised to initiate legal action against borrowers and guarantors for the recovery of dues. \u003cbr\u003e 5. Credit Information Reporting and Liability5. Credit Information Reporting and Liability \u003cbr\u003e 5. Credit Information Reporting and Liability \u003cbr\u003e 5. Credit Information Reporting and Liability \u003cbr\u003e Reporting of Defaulters \u003cbr\u003e Large Defaulters: Banks must submit monthly information on large defaulters to all Credit Information Companies (CICs), including lists of suitâ€filed accounts and nonâ€suitâ€filed accounts classified as doubtful or loss. The threshold for a large defaulter is â‚¹1 crore and above. \u003cbr\u003e Wilful Defaulters: Regions must submit monthly information on wilful defaulters to the Head Office for onward submission to all CICs. The outstanding amount for wilful defaulters must be \u003cbr\u003e â‚¹25 lakh or more. The name is removed from the LWD promptly once the outstanding amount falls below the threshold, subject to other conditions. \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of SettlementsTreatment of Settlements \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of Settlements \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of Settlements \u003cbr\u003e Compromise Settlements: An account in the LWD is removed only after the borrower has fully paid the compromise amount. If only part payment is made, the name remains on the list even if the outstanding amount falls below the â‚¹25 lakh threshold. \u003cbr\u003e Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC): If a resolution plan under IBC or the RBI\u0027s framework for stressed assets leads to a change in management, the names of the borrower, guarantor, and former promoters/directors are removed from the LWD. However, penal measures continue to apply to the erstwhile promoters and directors. \u003cbr\u003e Guarantor and Director ReportingGuarantor and Director Reporting \u003cbr\u003e Guarantor and Director Reporting \u003cbr\u003e Guarantor and Director Reporting \u003cbr\u003e Guarantors: The liability of a guarantor is coextensive with the principal debtor. If a guarantor fails to honor their commitment, they can also be classified as a wilful defaulter. \u003cbr\u003e Directors: Full names and Director Identification Numbers (DIN) of directors must be reported to ensure correct identification. \u003cbr\u003e 6. Preventive Measures and Role of Auditors6. Preventive Measures and Role of Auditors \u003cbr\u003e 6. Preventive Measures and Role of Auditors \u003cbr\u003e 6. Preventive Measures and Role of Auditors \u003cbr\u003e Credit Appraisal: During credit appraisal, banks must check if any director, guarantor, or person in charge of management is on the list of large defaulters or wilful defaulters. \u003cbr\u003e Monitoring End Use of Funds: Branches must closely monitor the endâ€use of funds, obtain certificates from borrowers, and may initiate legal action for false certification. Measures include scrutinizing financial statements, inspecting assets, visiting units, and obtaining certification from Chartered Accountants. \u003cbr\u003e Role of Statutory Auditors: If auditors are found to be negligent or deficient in their work, or if they falsify accounts, a complaint can be lodged with the National Financial Reporting \u003cbr\u003e Authority (NFRA) or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

The chapter outlines the definitions, guiding principles, and specific authorities for each method, including the prudential norms and guidelines from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It differentiates between rescheduling, rephasement, and restructuring, specifying the conditions under which each can be undertaken. \u003cbr\u003e 1. Rescheduling1. Rescheduling \u003cbr\u003e 1. Rescheduling \u003cbr\u003e 1. Rescheduling \u003cbr\u003e Rescheduling involves changing the pattern of a debt service obligation, such as shifting from an equated monthly installment to a ballooning or descending schedule. The key aspects of rescheduling are: \u003cbr\u003e No change in repayment period: The original repayment tenure of the loan remains the same. \u003cbr\u003e No increase in outstanding exposure: The total outstanding amount of the loan is not enhanced. \u003cbr\u003e No change in the nature or quantum of credit facilities: The type and amount of the credit facility remain unchanged. \u003cbr\u003e No fresh credit facility: No new or additional credit limits are sanctioned, even within the existing outstanding exposure. \u003cbr\u003e Applicability: Rescheduling can be applied to standard, substandard, and doubtful accounts. For substandard and doubtful accounts, staff accountability must be examined and documented. \u003cbr\u003e Temporary reduction: A rescheduling can involve a temporary reduction in installment amounts, with a corresponding increase in future installments to maintain the existing repayment period. \u003cbr\u003e Exclusions: Accounts of wilful defaulters or those where frauds have been committed cannot be rescheduled. \u003cbr\u003e Special Cases: A oneâ€time rescheduling not exceeding six months for temporary mismatches in funds is not considered restructuring. In genuine cases of retail loans to individuals, rescheduling can be considered by the Regional Authority after a thorough review. \u003cbr\u003e Authority: Senior Branch Managers and above can consider rescheduling for up to six months within their Discretionary Lending Powers (DLP), subject to approval from the Regional Office. Branch Heads in Scale I \u0026 II must refer all such cases to their respective Regional Offices for sanction. \u003cbr\u003e 2. Rephasement2. Rephasement \u003cbr\u003e 2. Rephasement \u003cbr\u003e 2. Rephasement \u003cbr\u003e Rephasement is a specific type of rescheduling that involves enhancing the repayment period. It is primarily considered for genuine cases of retail loans granted to individuals. The key conditions for rephasement are: \u003cbr\u003e Extended repayment period: The repayment period is extended beyond the original term. \u003cbr\u003e Retirement age limit: For salaried individuals, the repayment period cannot exceed their date of retirement. For others, it cannot exceed the age of 65. \u003cbr\u003e Authority: Similar to rescheduling, Senior Branch Managers and above can consider rephasement for up to six months within their DLP with Regional Office approval. Branch Heads in Scale I \u0026 II must refer these cases to their Regional Offices. \u003cbr\u003e 3. Restructuring3. Restructuring \u003cbr\u003e 3. Restructuring \u003cbr\u003e 3. Restructuring \u003cbr\u003e Restructuring is a more comprehensive process that can involve significant changes to the loan terms, including: \u003cbr\u003e Changes in loan terms: It can involve altering the repayment period, changing the outstanding exposure, and/or changing the nature and quantum of existing credit facilities. \u003cbr\u003e Additional finance: It may also include sanctioning fresh credit facilities or additional limits, whether within or beyond the existing outstanding exposure. \u003cbr\u003e Components of restructuring: Restructuring may involve a refund of penal interest, a reduction in the interest rate, funding of a core irregularity as a Working Capital Term Loan (WCTL), or funding of unpaid interest as a Funded Interest Term Loan (FITL). It can also include the reschedulement of existing installments and/or the sanction of fresh/additional term loan or working capital facilities. \u003cbr\u003e Guiding principles: Restructuring is undertaken based on the borrowerâ€™s sincerity, wherewithal, and capability to achieve a turnaround. Like rescheduling and rephasement, it is not permitted for wilful defaulters or accounts with fraud. All standard, substandard, and \u003cbr\u003e doubtful accounts are eligible for restructuring, with staff accountability being examined for the latter two. \u003cbr\u003e Obtaining security: Lenders should try to obtain the personal guarantee of promoter directors and additional tangible security, but restructuring should not be denied solely because the borrower cannot provide extra tangible security. \u003cbr\u003e Asset classification upgrade: Substandard and doubtful accounts that are restructured can be upgraded to the standard category after one year from the first payment of interest or principal, provided performance is satisfactory. \u003cbr\u003e Authority for Restructuring \u003cbr\u003e The authority to approve restructuring proposals depends on the involvement of sacrifice and additional funding: \u003cbr\u003e With sacrifice and additional funding: Regional Managers, Assistant General Managers, and above can approve restructuring up to their DLP. The authority level is determined by the quantum of sacrifice (writeâ€off/waiver) and the total exposure (including additional funding). \u003cbr\u003e Without sacrifice but with additional funding: Chief Managers and above can consider restructuring up to their DLP without any sacrifice but with additional funding. \u003cbr\u003e RBI Guidelines on Restructuring \u003cbr\u003e The document also incorporates RBI\u0027s master circular guidelines on restructuring. \u003cbr\u003e Stages of restructuring: Restructuring can occur before or after the commencement of commercial production, and before or after an asset is classified as substandard. \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of restructured standard accounts: \u003cbr\u003e Rescheduling of principal alone on a standard, fully secured loan will not downgrade the asset classification. \u003cbr\u003e If interest is rescheduled, any sacrifice in the present value of the interest must be written off or provisioned for. The present value is calculated by discounting future interest at a rate appropriate to the borrower\u0027s risk category (current BPLR + credit risk premium). \u003cbr\u003e Treatment of restructured substandard accounts: \u003cbr\u003e A rescheduling of principal on a substandard, fully secured loan allows it to remain in the substandard category for a specified period. \u003cbr\u003e Any sacrifice in the present value of the interest must be written off or provisioned for. \u003cbr\u003e The asset will continue to be treated as substandard even if past interest dues are written off. \u003cbr\u003e General norms: \u003cbr\u003e These guidelines apply to all fully secured credit facilities, but not to credit extended to traders. \u003cbr\u003e Collateral security that is tangible and properly charged can be considered. \u003cbr\u003e Restructuring cannot be done with retrospective effect. \u003cbr\u003e Repeated restructuring is discouraged unless there are strong and valid reasons. \u003cbr\u003e Restructuring must always be based on viability parameters and sound cash flow analysis. \u003cbr\u003e Income recognition and provisioning: \u003cbr\u003e Income recognition for Nonâ€Performing Assets (NPAs) must be on a cash basis. \u003cbr\u003e Any funded interest, if recognized as income, must be fully provisioned for. \u003cbr\u003e Provisioning for interest sacrifice in a restructured account can be reversed only after the loan is fully repaid and all repayment obligations are met. \u003cbr\u003e Restructured/rescheduled accounts can be upgraded to standard category only after one year of satisfactory performance. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e What is the primary characteristic of \u0027Rescheduling\u0027? \u003cbr\u003e Enhancing the repayment period only. \u003cbr\u003e Changing the debt service obligation without changing the repayment period. \u003cbr\u003e Sanctioning fresh credit facilities within the existing outstanding exposure. \u003cbr\u003e Refund of penal interest with retrospective effect. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B.

It highlights the benefits of Lok Adalats, the specific types of cases that can be referred to them, the procedural steps involved, and the financial and legal implications of settlements reached through this forum. \u003cbr\u003e 1. Introduction and Guiding Principles1. Introduction and Guiding Principles \u003cbr\u003e 1. Introduction and Guiding Principles \u003cbr\u003e 1. Introduction and Guiding Principles \u003cbr\u003e A Lok Adalat is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. It provides a way to administer justice without resorting to conventional court proceedings, making it a \"fastest and cheapest mode of settlement of disputes\". Banks are \u003cbr\u003e encouraged to use Lok Adalats for compromise settlements, especially for \"hardcore cases\". States have established Legal Services Authorities at the High Court, District, and Taluka levels to organize these Adalats. \u003cbr\u003e The key advantages of using a Lok Adalat include: \u003cbr\u003e No court fee for fresh disputes. \u003cbr\u003e The ability to handle both existing suits in court and fresh disputes. \u003cbr\u003e The option for parties to continue with court proceedings if no settlement is reached. \u003cbr\u003e Every award is considered a civil court decree that is binding on the parties, and execution proceedings can be filed accordingly. \u003cbr\u003e No appeal is possible against a Lok Adalat decree as settlements are based on mutual consent. \u003cbr\u003e Court fees already paid in suitâ€filed cases are refunded if a settlement is reached. \u003cbr\u003e 2. Guidelines for Organizing and Referring Cases to Lok Adalats2. Guidelines for Organizing and Referring Cases to Lok Adalats \u003cbr\u003e 2. Guidelines for Organizing and Referring Cases to Lok Adalats \u003cbr\u003e 2. Guidelines for Organizing and Referring Cases to Lok Adalats \u003cbr\u003e To organize a Lok Adalat, banks must contact the State/District/Taluka Level Legal Services Committees. It is recommended to identify an area with a large number of branches to maximize participation. \u003cbr\u003e Eligible AccountsEligible Accounts \u003cbr\u003e Eligible Accounts \u003cbr\u003e Eligible Accounts \u003cbr\u003e Cases involving amounts up to â‚¹20.00 lacs can be referred to Lok Adalats. However, when DRTs (Debt Recovery Tribunals) organize Lok Adalats for pending cases, there is no limit on the amount involved. The following types of accounts are eligible for reference: \u003cbr\u003e Accounts under the Doubtful and Loss category (including PWO accounts) that have been classified as NPA for more than six months. \u003cbr\u003e Both suitâ€filed and other accounts where all possible recovery measures have been exhausted. \u003cbr\u003e Accounts that have been directly categorized into Doubtful/Loss cannot be considered for settlement before six months of being classified as NPA. \u003cbr\u003e Case Selection and PreparationCase Selection and Preparation \u003cbr\u003e Case Selection and Preparation \u003cbr\u003e Case Selection and Preparation \u003cbr\u003e Branches must identify eligible borrower accounts and prepare a list. When finalizing this list, they should consider the willingness and net worth of the borrower/guarantors, as well as the value and nature of available securities. While preâ€litigation disputes can be taken up, priority should be given to old suitâ€filed cases pending for more than three years. \u003cbr\u003e Process and SettlementProcess and Settlement \u003cbr\u003e Process and Settlement \u003cbr\u003e Process and Settlement \u003cbr\u003e Branches should try to arrange preâ€Adalat sittings with borrowers and guarantors to negotiate and reach a settlement beforehand. The bank officials attending the Lok Adalat must have the necessary delegated powers for compromise and sacrifice to make onâ€theâ€spot decisions. \u003cbr\u003e Settlement terms must include a default clause. This clause stipulates that if the borrower defaults on the compromise amount, the entire original contractual amount, including interest and costs, becomes immediately payable, minus any amount already received. \u003cbr\u003e After a settlement is reached, the branch must obtain a Recovery Certificate or Decree where \u003cbr\u003e applicable and closely monitor the account to ensure full recovery of the compromised amount. The bank should also apply for a refund of any court fees paid. \u003cbr\u003e 3. Settlement Formula and Financial Implications3. Settlement Formula and Financial Implications \u003cbr\u003e 3. Settlement Formula and Financial Implications \u003cbr\u003e 3. Settlement Formula and Financial Implications \u003cbr\u003e Negotiations should begin with the total gross dues. However, in specific genuine cases, a bank may accept a lower amount if the value of security is negligible, the borrower\u0027s worth is low, or the cost and duration of the suit are high. \u003cbr\u003e P\u0026L Impact: The branch should aim for a settlement with no adverse impact on the Profit \u0026 Loss Account.

It serves as a comprehensive guide for banks and \u003cbr\u003e financial institutions on how to use this Act as a tool for resolving Nonâ€Performing Assets (NPAs). The chapter covers the core provisions of the Act, the procedural requirements for enforcement, the role of CERSAI, and various methods for selling secured assets. \u003cbr\u003e 1. Core Concepts and Applicability of SARFAESI Act1. Core Concepts and Applicability of SARFAESI Act \u003cbr\u003e 1. Core Concepts and Applicability of SARFAESI Act \u003cbr\u003e 1. Core Concepts and Applicability of SARFAESI Act \u003cbr\u003e The SARFAESI Act empowers secured creditors to enforce their security interests and recover dues without the intervention of a court. It applies to both movable and immovable assets, such as \u003cbr\u003e vehicles, plant, machinery, and properties, but explicitly excludes agricultural land. The Act also provides a legal framework for the securitization of assets and allows banks to transfer NPAs to specialized asset reconstruction companies. A significant provision of the Act is that a bank can initiate action under SARFAESI even while a suit is pending under the DRT Act. \u003cbr\u003e For a bank to initiate action under the SARFAESI Act, certain conditions must be met: \u003cbr\u003e The contractual dues must be more than â‚¹1 lac. \u003cbr\u003e The account must be classified as an NPA. \u003cbr\u003e The security must be specific, clear, and duly charged to the bank. \u003cbr\u003e The security documents must be in full force on the date the 60â€day notice is served. \u003cbr\u003e For consortium lending, the consent of secured lenders representing at least 60% of the outstanding amount is required. However, a bank can proceed independently if the security is exclusively charged to them, treating themselves as the sole banker. \u003cbr\u003e The action must be initiated within the limitation period as the SARFAESI action itself does not extend the limitation period for filing a suit. \u003cbr\u003e 2. CERSAI Registration: A Mandatory Requirement2. CERSAI Registration: A Mandatory Requirement \u003cbr\u003e 2. CERSAI Registration: A Mandatory Requirement \u003cbr\u003e 2. CERSAI Registration: A Mandatory Requirement \u003cbr\u003e A critical aspect of enforcing security under the SARFAESI Act is the mandatory registration of the charge with the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI). \u003cbr\u003e Priority of Charge: Registration with CERSAI provides public notice of the charge. A registered charge gives the secured creditor (the bank) priority over any subsequent security interests \u003cbr\u003e created on the property. This also means the bank\u0027s dues will have priority over all other dues, revenues, taxes, and cesses payable to the Central or State Government or any local authority. \u003cbr\u003e Consequences of Non-Registration: If the charge is not registered with CERSAI, the bank cannot proceed under the SARFAESI Act against that property. A charge registered by another creditor, even if they are not a bank, would take priority, jeopardizing the bank\u0027s interest. \u003cbr\u003e New Provisions: The document highlights recent amendments to the SARFAESI Act, which have removed the earlier provisions for timeâ€bound registration and penalties. Now, other creditors and even government authorities can register attachment orders with CERSAI. \u003cbr\u003e 3. Issuance and Service of Notices3. Issuance and Service of Notices \u003cbr\u003e 3. Issuance and Service of Notices \u003cbr\u003e 3.

It must contain the contractual dues up to the date of service and a detailed description of the secured assets. It must give the borrower sixty days to discharge their liabilities. \u003cbr\u003e Notice service can be done via registered post, courier, speed post, or electronic mail. A copy of the notice must also be affixed on the secured assets. If the notice is returned unserved, its contents should be published in two leading newspapers. All relevant documents, including proof of dispatch, acknowledgements, and newspaper publications, must be kept in safe custody. \u003cbr\u003e 4. Taking Possession and Valuation of Secured Assets4.

Taking Possession and Valuation of Secured Assets \u003cbr\u003e If the borrower fails to pay within the 60â€day notice period, the bank\u0027s Authorised Officer can proceed to take possession of the secured assets under Section 13(4). \u003cbr\u003e Physical Possession: For movable assets, a physical possession is taken in the presence of two independent witnesses, and an inventory is prepared. For immovable assets, a possession notice is affixed to a conspicuous part of the property and published in two leading newspapers within seven days. \u003cbr\u003e Assistance from Authorities: If the Authorised Officer faces resistance, they can approach the concerned District Magistrate (DM) or Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) under Section 14 of the Act for assistance in taking possession. The DM/CMM must pass an order on the application within 30 days, or a maximum of 60 days with recorded reasons. \u003cbr\u003e Valuation and Reserve Price: Before sale, a fresh valuation of the secured assets must be obtained from an approved valuer. A committee fixes the reserve price based on the realizable value. For assets valued over â‚¹5 crore, two valuation reports are required, and if the variance is more than 25%, a third valuation must be obtained. \u003cbr\u003e 5. Sale of Secured Assets5.

Sale of Secured Assets \u003cbr\u003e The sale of secured assets can be done through various methods: public auction, inviting tenders, or private treaty. \u003cbr\u003e Public Sale: For a public auction or tender, a public notice must be published in two leading newspapers (one vernacular) with a clear 30-day notice period before the sale. The notice must contain details of the borrower, secured creditor, and a description of the assets. \u003cbr\u003e Private Treaty: This method is only to be used after at least two failed public auctions or tender attempts. The sale price cannot be below the reserve price fixed in the last failed auction. \u003cbr\u003e Right of Redemption: A borrower has the right to redeem the secured assets by tendering the full dues, including costs and expenses, at any time before the publication of the notice for public auction. After publication, the right to redeem is no longer available. \u003cbr\u003e Sale Confirmation: The highest bidder must pay 25% of the sale price immediately and the remaining 75% within 15 days of the sale confirmation letter, with a maximum extension of up to three months.

Re-Possession of Vehicle \u003cbr\u003e The reâ€possession process is based on the legal provisions available in the security document, \u003cbr\u003e specifically the \"Instrument of Hypothecation of Vehicle\". This instrument gives the bank the right to take possession, seize, and sell the vehicle if the borrower defaults on payments. The bank also obtains blank TTO (Transfer of Ownership) forms signed by the borrower to facilitate the sale process. \u003cbr\u003e The guidelines for seizing a vehicle are as follows: \u003cbr\u003e Identification of Accounts: Branches must identify all vehicle loan accounts, both standard and NPA, that have overdues of more than 30 days. \u003cbr\u003e Initial Notice: The branch must send a letter to the borrower requesting them to clear the overdue amount within 15 days. \u003cbr\u003e Recall Notice: If the borrower fails to make the payment, a recall notice is sent, demanding the entire outstanding amount within a 30â€day period. This notice must be sent via \u003cbr\u003e Registered Post with Acknowledgement Due or through speed post, and proof of delivery must be preserved. \u003cbr\u003e Seizure: If the borrower still fails to pay, the branch, through its Regional Office, will allot the case to an empanelled Enforcement/Recovery Agency to seize the vehicle.

This is done without waiving the claims \u003cbr\u003e against the borrower and does not prejudice the bank\u0027s ability to recover the funds. It\u0027s typically used for accounts that don\u0027t generate income or whose presence on the balance sheet is considered \u003cbr\u003e undesirable. This process is applied on a caseâ€byâ€case basis. \u003cbr\u003e TWO is generally resorted to for NPAs in the Doubtful and Loss categories where 100% provision has already been made in the books. The bank decides on a technical writeâ€off by looking at the prospect of immediate recovery. \u003cbr\u003e Committee and Authority for TWO \u003cbr\u003e A decision on Prudential / Technical Writeâ€Off is always made by a committee at the Head Office level, which is headed by the Chairman. The committee\u0027s constitution includes the Chairman, \u003cbr\u003e General Manager, Assistant General Manager (Credit/Credit Monitoring), Chief Manager (Credit/Recovery) \u0026 Chief Manager (Operations), Senior Manager (Credit) \u0026 Sr. Manager \u003cbr\u003e (Operations/Recovery), and Sr. Manager (Rec.)/ Manager (Rec) in charge at HO. The quorum for this committee consists of the Chairman, General Manager, one Chief Manager, and one Senior Manager \u0026 Sr. Manager (Rec.)/Recovery In charge at HO. The convener is the Senior Manager/In charge of \u003cbr\u003e Recovery at HO (NPA Mgmt.). \u003cbr\u003e The authority to approve a TWO can be granted on an accountâ€byâ€account basis or for a class of \u003cbr\u003e accounts, considering factors like outstanding balance, sector, or age of the NPA. No authority other than the committee mentioned above is permitted to technically write off an account. Once sanctioned by the Chairman, the accounts are reported to the Board of Directors. \u003cbr\u003e Process and Implications of TWO \u003cbr\u003e Even after an account is technically written off, the bank continues to pursue recovery actions. This includes filing suits, taking legal actions, and using the SARFAESI Act. The branches continue to monitor these accounts, and the followâ€up actions are managed by respective Regional Heads and \u003cbr\u003e the Head Office. Technical writeâ€offs can be undertaken for accounts classified as willful defaulters or frauds without impacting ongoing criminal proceedings against them. \u003cbr\u003e If a branch recovers funds and upgrades a technically writtenâ€off account, the General Manager at \u003cbr\u003e the Head Office is the competent authority to reverse the TWO and authorize the necessary reversal entries. \u003cbr\u003e Technical writeâ€offs for specific types of accounts are considered on a caseâ€byâ€case basis after a thorough scrutiny. These accounts include: \u003cbr\u003e TODs (Temporary Overdrafts) in current/savings accounts and adâ€hoc/oneâ€time bills purchase/discounting. \u003cbr\u003e Accounts where frauds have been reported. \u003cbr\u003e Quick Mortality accounts (NPAs within one year of sanction). \u003cbr\u003e Staff accounts and staffâ€related/guaranteed accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Advance accounts (like Cash Credit, Demand Loan, and Term Loan) where the borrower also has outstanding TODs in other accounts. \u003cbr\u003e Since the provisioning for these accounts is debited to the profit and loss account, any recovery directly increases the bank\u0027s profit. For exposures that are technically written off and then settled under a compromise or OTS (Oneâ€Time Settlement) framework, the cooling period is as per that \u003cbr\u003e framework. In other cases, no new exposure will be sanctioned until the outstanding dues under TWO are recovered. \u003cbr\u003e Accounting Procedure for TWOAccounting Procedure for TWO \u003cbr\u003e Accounting Procedure for TWO \u003cbr\u003e Accounting Procedure for TWO \u003cbr\u003e No accounting entries are to be passed at the Branch or Regional Office level for a TWO. The accounts remain as any other NPA account. All entries related to the technical writeâ€off are processed only at the Head Office. \u003cbr\u003e Final Write-OffFinal Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Final Write-Off is considered by a bank only when there is absolutely no chance of further recovery in the account. This applies when all possible recovery measures have been exhausted. These \u003cbr\u003e measures include the realization of charged assets, proceeding against uncharged assets of the \u003cbr\u003e borrower and guarantor, and personal liability proceedings. A final writeâ€off is also considered when continuing the account in the books would only add to the bank\u0027s cost and waste resources. It is crucial that a thorough check has been made and it has been confirmed that the \u003cbr\u003e borrower/guarantors (or their legal heirs) have no available assets or means of repayment. \u003cbr\u003e Coverage and Conditions for Final Write-OffCoverage and Conditions for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Coverage and Conditions for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Coverage and Conditions for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Accounts can be considered for a final writeâ€off if they meet certain conditions: \u003cbr\u003e There are no realizable assets available for recovery. \u003cbr\u003e There has been no recovery for a long time, and even after selling secured assets under the SARFAESI Act, the entire loan is not recovered, and there is no possibility of recovering the remaining amount. \u003cbr\u003e The account is classified as \u003cbr\u003e Doubtful-III, Doubtful-Unsecured, or a Loss Asset, and/or was previously Prudentially/Technically Written Off. \u003cbr\u003e Staff accountability has been examined and appropriately addressed. \u003cbr\u003e The borrowers/guarantors are either untraceable or lack the means to repay the loan, and there is no possibility of recovery. \u003cbr\u003e Delegation of Authority for Final Write-OffDelegation of Authority for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Delegation of Authority for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e Delegation of Authority for Final Write-Off \u003cbr\u003e No final writeâ€off will be considered at the branch level, and Branch Heads are not delegated any authority to sanction it. The branch identifies the eligible account and submits a proposal in a prescribed format to the Regional Manager, including a Staff Accountability Certificate and a Compliance Certificate, along with detailed justifications and recommendations. \u003cbr\u003e The delegation of authority for Final Writeâ€Off is structured by position and discretionary power: \u003cbr\u003e Regional Manager (Scale IV): Up to Rs. 75,000 (Book Dues). \u003cbr\u003e Regional Manager (Scale V): Up to Rs. 1,50,000 (Book Dues). \u003cbr\u003e General Manager: Up to Rs. 3,00,000 (Book Dues). \u003cbr\u003e Chairman: Up to Rs. 5,00,000 (Book Dues). \u003cbr\u003e Board of Directors: Full Power. \u003cbr\u003e Book Dues in the context of a final writeâ€off refers to the outstanding dues plus any charges outstanding in NPA expenses or otherwise for the concerned account. \u003cbr\u003e A committee approach is adopted for final writeâ€off proposals. The \u003cbr\u003e Settlement Advisory Committee (SAC) examines and recommends the proposal to the sanctioning authority. The SAC functions at both the Head Office (HO) and Regional Office (RO) levels. After the sanction, the next higher authority conducts a Post Sanction Review (PSR). All sanctioned proposals are placed before the Board members at their next meeting for perusal. \u003cbr\u003e Recovery Through State Government ActsRecovery Through State Government Acts \u003cbr\u003e Recovery Through State Government Acts \u003cbr\u003e Recovery Through State Government Acts \u003cbr\u003e In some states, specific acts are promulgated to facilitate the speedy recovery of bank dues, especially in small loans and agricultural loans sanctioned under state governmentâ€sponsored schemes. \u003cbr\u003e U.P.

According to this act, if a farmer who has taken a loan for agricultural purposes fails to repay, the bank can issue a certificate to the District Collector. The certificate requests the Collector to recover the bank dues, along with recovery expenses, as arrears of land revenue. The District Collector then takes appropriate steps to recover the dues. This act also provides for the recovery of dues from the legal representatives of deceased agriculturists and guarantors. \u003cbr\u003e U.P. Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1972U.P.

All practices for followâ€up, recovery, and repossession must be in accordance with the law. \u003cbr\u003e General Guidelines for Debt CollectionGeneral Guidelines for Debt Collection \u003cbr\u003e General Guidelines for Debt Collection \u003cbr\u003e General Guidelines for Debt Collection \u003cbr\u003e Any bank staff member or authorized person involved in debt collection or security repossession must adhere to specific guidelines: \u003cbr\u003e Contacting the Borrower: The customer should be contacted at a location of their choice, or if no location is specified, at their residence, or their place of business if they are not at home. \u003cbr\u003e Identity and Authority: The identity and authority of the bank\u0027s representatives must be disclosed to borrowers at the first interaction. They must carry and display a valid authority letter from the bank upon request. \u003cbr\u003e Communication: All communication, whether written or verbal, should be in simple business language and conducted with \"civil manners\". The bank is committed to respecting the \u003cbr\u003e privacy of its borrowers. \u003cbr\u003e Timing: The representatives will normally contact borrowers between 08:00 and 19:00 hours. Contact outside these hours is permitted only if required by the special circumstances of the borrower\u0027s business or occupation. The bank will honor requests from borrowers to avoid calls at specific times or places whenever possible. \u003cbr\u003e Documentation and Assistance: The bank will document all recovery efforts and a gist of interactions with borrowers. The bank is committed to assisting in resolving disputes in a mutually acceptable and orderly manner. \u003cbr\u003e Sensitive Situations: Visits or calls to collect dues should be avoided during inappropriate times, such as a bereavement or other calamitous occasions. \u003cbr\u003e Legal Action: If a party disposes of a security charged to the bank, an FIR (First Information Report) will be lodged after giving a 30â€day notice to the borrower, mortgagor, and purchaser. \u003cbr\u003e Notices and RepossessionNotices and Repossession \u003cbr\u003e Notices and Repossession \u003cbr\u003e Notices and Repossession \u003cbr\u003e The bank will not initiate any legal or recovery measures, including the repossession of security, without first providing a due notice in writing to the borrower. A minimum of seven days is given to \u003cbr\u003e the borrower to pay the debt. If the borrower fails to pay, the bank can proceed with repossession of the asset. However, if the customer deliberately avoids communication with the bank, the bank is \u003cbr\u003e free to proceed with repossession without delay. \u003cbr\u003e Repossession of security is a recovery tool and not a means to deprive the borrower of their property. The process involves repossession, valuation, and realization of the security in a fair and transparent manner. Repossession is carried out only after issuing the \u003cbr\u003e third and final notice. The bank will follow the due process of law and take reasonable care to ensure the safety of the repossessed property, charging any necessary costs to the borrower. \u003cbr\u003e Right to Set-OffRight to Set-Off \u003cbr\u003e Right to Set-Off \u003cbr\u003e Right to Set-Off \u003cbr\u003e The right of set-off, also known as the right of combination of accounts, allows a bank to adjust a debt owed to a customer against a debt due from them. This means a customer with a debt to the bank may be unable to make withdrawals from their account. It also enables the bank to debit any amount due to itself from the customer\u0027s credit balance. \u003cbr\u003e There are exceptions to this right: \u003cbr\u003e A bank cannot set off a debt owed by a single customer against a joint account. \u003cbr\u003e A bank cannot transfer money from a joint account to satisfy a debt in an individual account of one of the joint holders. \u003cbr\u003e This limitation can be overcome if there is an express contract stating that one joint account holder guarantees the personal debts of the other. \u003cbr\u003e In NPA (Nonâ€Performing Asset) accounts, a branch may set off a borrower\u0027s deposits that are liened toward the advance, with the permission of the Regional Head. This action requires at least seven days\u0027 notice to the borrower or guarantor to repay their dues. This type of recovery does not change the account\u0027s categorization, meaning it will still be classified as an NPA. \u003cbr\u003e Valuation and Sale of PropertyValuation and Sale of Property \u003cbr\u003e Valuation and Sale of Property \u003cbr\u003e Valuation and Sale of Property \u003cbr\u003e Valuation and sale of repossessed property must be fair, transparent, and in accordance with the law. After the sale, the bank has the right to recover any remaining balance from the borrower. If there is any excess amount after covering all expenses, it will be returned to the borrower, provided the bank has no other claims against them. \u003cbr\u003e For hypothecated assets, a sale notice will be given as per the SARFAESI Act or other applicable law if no payment is made after repossession. The bank will then arrange for the sale, which may include \u003cbr\u003e e-auctions. If the sale is by public auction or tender, it must be advertised in two leading newspapers, one of which must be a local vernacular paper. \u003cbr\u003e Engagement of Recovery Agents \u003cbr\u003e The bank may use recovery agents for collecting dues and repossessing securities. These agents must be from an approved panel. The bank will disclose the agent\u0027s identity to the borrower , and the \u003cbr\u003e agents are required to follow a specific code of conduct. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e The bank\u0027s debt collection policy is built around which of the following principles? \u003cbr\u003e Aggression and coercionB.

Give due notice in writing. \u003cbr\u003e SUMMARY OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY \u003cbr\u003e Introduction \u003cbr\u003e Risk is the fundamental element that affects financial behaviour. Risk is a measure of uncertainty or a measure to capture the potential of sustaining a loss. Operational Risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Deregulation and globalization of financial services, together with the growing sophistication of financial technology, are making the activities of RRBs and their profiles more complex. Evolving banking practices suggest that risks other than credit risks and market risks can be substantial. \u003cbr\u003e Examples of these new and growing risks faced by banks include: \u003cbr\u003e Highly Automated Technology \u003cbr\u003e Emergence of Eâ€ Commerce \u003cbr\u003e Emergence of RRBs acting as service providers \u003cbr\u003e Outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e Mergers and consolidations test the viability of new or newly integrated systems \u003cbr\u003e Banks may engage in risk mitigation techniques (e.g. collateral, netting arrangements and asset securitizations) to optimize their exposure to market risk and credit risk, but which in turn may produce other forms of risk (e.g. legal risk). \u003cbr\u003e Increasing incidents of fraud \u003cbr\u003e Fierce competition among banks. \u003cbr\u003e Customerâ€centric approach that has the potential for dilution of systems and controls. \u003cbr\u003e Banks acting as very large volume providers create need for continual maintenance of highâ€ grade internal controls and backâ€up systems. \u003cbr\u003e Objective \u003cbr\u003e Develop a robust and comprehensive operational risk management framework commensurate with the Bank\u0027s risk profile and risk appetite. \u003cbr\u003e Define all the components and aspects of the operational risk management framework. \u003cbr\u003e Define and implement risk governance structure as per regulatory guidelines, best governance standards and practices and risk accountability requirement. \u003cbr\u003e Enable the senior management and the Board to take business decisions involving operational risk. \u003cbr\u003e Compliance with requirements for regulatory guidelines for operational risk management. \u003cbr\u003e Strengthen internal control environment, including internal audit and implement other operational risk management tools and measures in a costâ€effective manner. \u003cbr\u003e Reduction of actual and potential operational risk losses. \u003cbr\u003e Enhance market discipline by specifying disclosure requirements. \u003cbr\u003e Create culture and environment for the effective management of operational risk in the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e Facilitate the enhancement and improvement of the business and operational processes of the Bank from time to time through their review in the light of the operational risk events occurring within the Bank and those reported elsewhere in the financial sector in India and are in the knowledge of the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e 3.Scope3.Scope \u003cbr\u003e 3.Scope \u003cbr\u003e 3.Scope \u003cbr\u003e All the manuals, procedures, guidelines, methodology, approach, system, data, tools, developed to implement this policy will form an integral part of this policy and will be called \"Bank\u0027s Operational Risk Management Framework\". \u003cbr\u003e The Bank has separate functions for management of risks related to information security, compliance, fraud prevention, business continuity planning/disaster recovery planning (BCP/DRP), outsourcing of financial services. Hence, this policy and all other components of operational risk framework do not cover detailed requirements w.r.t. these areas. \u003cbr\u003e Definition of Operational Risk \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk is a fundamental part of doing business and cannot be fully eliminated. Unlike Market and Credit risk which tend to be in specific area of business, Operational Risk is inherent in Bankâ€™s all business processes and operations. Operational Risk is pervasive, complex and dynamic. \u003cbr\u003e Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has defined Operational Risk as under: \u003cbr\u003e Risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk*, but excludes strategic and reputational risks.â€ \u003cbr\u003e The definition of Operational Risk is mainly â€˜â€˜causalâ€basedâ€™â€™ and depending upon underlying causes of Operational Risk incidents. Definition aims to identify why a loss happened by providing a breakdown of causes into four categories: \u003cbr\u003e People, \u003cbr\u003e Processes, \u003cbr\u003e Systems, and \u003cbr\u003e External factors. \u003cbr\u003e Legal \u003cbr\u003e *Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to fines, penalties or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as ordinary damages in civil litigation, related legal costs and private settlements. \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Framework and Operational Risk Management System Management of operational risk includes its identification, assessment, measurement, control, mitigation, analysis, monitoring and reporting, which requires Bank to have a robust and \u003cbr\u003e comprehensive operational risk management framework (ORMF) and operational risk management system (ORMS). \u003cbr\u003e ORMF comprises: \u003cbr\u003e the organizational structure for management of operational risk; \u003cbr\u003e governance structures; \u003cbr\u003e policies, procedures and processes; \u003cbr\u003e Systems used by the Bank in identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and mitigating operational risk. \u003cbr\u003e ORMS is a subset of ORMF. \u003cbr\u003e Following are the key components for the purpose of implementation of operational risk management framework: \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Policy \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Culture \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Profile \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Strategy \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Governance Structure (including Roles and Responsibilities) \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Process \u003cbr\u003e Internal Loss Data Management \u003cbr\u003e External Loss Data Management \u003cbr\u003e Risk Appetite \u003cbr\u003e Risk and Control Selfâ€Assessment \u003cbr\u003e New Product / Activities Approval \u003cbr\u003e Key Risk Indicators \u003cbr\u003e Scenario Analysis \u003cbr\u003e Business Environment and Internal Control Factors \u003cbr\u003e Internal Control Environment \u003cbr\u003e Insurance as Risk Mitigant \u003cbr\u003e Outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e Business Continuity Planning \u003cbr\u003e Sensitivity Analysis \u003cbr\u003e Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting \u003cbr\u003e System, Tools and Models \u003cbr\u003e Resources and Training \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Culture Risk Culture is a combined set of individual and corporate values, attitudes, competencies and behaviour that determine the Bank\u0027s commitment and style of risk management. \u003cbr\u003e Operational risk culture is the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterize how the Bank considers risks in its day to day operations. The key to create an operational risk culture is the goal of the risk management that should be aligned with the institution\u0027s business goals. \u003cbr\u003e Strong risk culture manages emerging risks and opportunities in a rapidly changing environment; a weak risk culture increases the vulnerability of the Bank to risk occurrences, \"near misses,\" and forgone opportunities. \u003cbr\u003e The Board of Directors and senior management are responsible for creating an awareness of operational risks and establishing a culture within the Bank that emphasizes and demonstrates to all the levels of personnel the importance of operational risk management. \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Governance Structure \u003cbr\u003e Following is the Bank level operational risk management governance structure: \u003cbr\u003e Sub-Committee of the Board i.e. RMCB(Policy, Strategy and Review for Risk ManagementBOARD OF DIRECTORS(Decide overall risk management policy and strategy)Sub-Committee of the Board i.e. RMCB(Policy, Strategy and Review for Risk ManagementBOARD OF DIRECTORS(Decide overall risk management policy and strategy) \u003cbr\u003e Sub-Committee of the Board i.e. RMCB \u003cbr\u003e (Policy, Strategy and Review for Risk Management \u003cbr\u003e BOARD OF DIRECTORS \u003cbr\u003e (Decide overall risk management policy and strategy) \u003cbr\u003e Sub-Committee of the Board i.e. RMCB \u003cbr\u003e (Policy, Strategy and Review for Risk Management \u003cbr\u003e BOARD OF DIRECTORS \u003cbr\u003e (Decide overall risk management policy and strategy) \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Committee (Headed by General Manager)Operational Risk Management Committee (Headed by General Manager) \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Committee (Headed by General Manager) \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Management Committee (Headed by General Manager) \u003cbr\u003e Product \u0026 Process Approval Committee (Headed by GM of Department Concerned)Product \u0026 Process Approval Committee (Headed by GM of Department Concerned) \u003cbr\u003e Product \u0026 Process Approval Committee (Headed by GM of Department Concerned) \u003cbr\u003e Product \u0026 Process Approval Committee (Headed by GM of Department Concerned) \u003cbr\u003e Risk and Controls Self-Assessment CommitteeRisk and Controls Self-Assessment Committee \u003cbr\u003e Risk and Controls Self-Assessment Committee \u003cbr\u003e Risk and Controls Self-Assessment Committee \u003cbr\u003e ORM Cell / Department or Risk Management DepartmentORM Cell / Department or Risk Management Department \u003cbr\u003e ORM Cell / Department or Risk Management Department \u003cbr\u003e ORM Cell / Department or Risk Management Department \u003cbr\u003e Risk Assessment Committee of DepartmentRisk Assessment Committee of Department \u003cbr\u003e Risk Assessment Committee of Department \u003cbr\u003e Risk Assessment Committee of Department \u003cbr\u003e Department Heads \u003cbr\u003e Business Operational Risk Manager / Operational Risk Management Specialist \u003cbr\u003e Departments / Functions \u003cbr\u003e Advances \u003cbr\u003e ","title":"KYC compliance.","id":19},{"content":"Credit Monitoring \u003cbr\u003e Digital Services \u003cbr\u003e Financial Inclusion \u003cbr\u003e Human Resource Management \u003cbr\u003e IT \u0026 Call Centre \u003cbr\u003e Referral, Wealth Management \u003cbr\u003e Recovery \u0026 NPA Management \u003cbr\u003e Legal \u0026 RTI \u003cbr\u003e Grievances \u0026 Complaints \u003cbr\u003e Operations \u003cbr\u003e Accounts \u0026 Taxation \u003cbr\u003e Pension \u0026 Payroll \u003cbr\u003e Office Administration \u003cbr\u003e Planning \u003cbr\u003e Treasury \u0026 Investment \u003cbr\u003e ","title":"Credit Monitoring","id":20},{"content":"Vigilance \u003cbr\u003e Roles \u0026 Responsibilities: Keeping in view the NABARD guidelines, Bank has detailed the Roles \u0026 Responsibilities of key personnel, viz.

Since a significant aspect of managing operational risk relates to the establishment of strong internal controls, it is particularly important that the Board establishes clear lines of management responsibility, accountability and reporting. In addition, there should be separation of responsibilities and reporting lines between operational risk control functions, business lines and support functions in order to avoid conflicts of interest. \u003cbr\u003e Board shall review the framework regularly to ensure that the bank is managing the operational risks arising from external market changes and other environmental factors, as well as those operational risks associated with new products, activities or systems. This review process should also aim to assess industry best practice in ORM appropriate for the bankâ€™s activities, systems and processes. If necessary, the Board should ensure that the ORM framework is revised in light of this analysis, so that material operational risks are captured within. \u003cbr\u003e Board should ensure that the bank has in place adequate internal audit coverage to satisfy itself that policies and procedures have been implemented effectively. The ORM framework should be subjected to an effective and comprehensive internal audit by operationally independent, appropriately trained and competent staff not directly involved in the ORM process. \u003cbr\u003e Board should receive regular and focused training to understand and execute its ORM responsibilities, such as ethics, fraud management, business continuity, succession planning, etc. \u003cbr\u003e Responsibility of Senior Management \u003cbr\u003e Senior management has the responsibility for implementing the Board approved ORM framework.

They are responsible for implementing corrective action plan to address process and control deficiencies. \u003cbr\u003e Second Line of Defence: Risk Management and Compliance functions \u003cbr\u003e Risk Management Function designs, implements, coâ€ordinates, reports and facilitates effective Operational Risk Management on bank wide basis and complements the business lineâ€™s Operational Risk management activities in coâ€ordination with other concerned Functional Departments. \u003cbr\u003e Third Line of Defence: Internal Audit function \u003cbr\u003e Internal Audit periodically reviews policies and procedures that are appropriate and are implemented effectively. Internal audit works as an independent function and provides assurance to Board / Board Committee on the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management framework. \u003cbr\u003e Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for Operational Risk Management \u003cbr\u003e As per NABARD guidance note EC No. 38/DoSâ€04/2023â€2024 dated 14.03.2024, RRBs are currently not required to calculate operational risk capital charge. However, Bank may adopt the approach mentioned below in due course for capital computation. \u003cbr\u003e Four main inputs for capital computation under AMA are as under: \u003cbr\u003e 111794Internal Loss Data \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e External Loss Data \u003cbr\u003e Scenario Analysis \u003cbr\u003e Stress Testing \u003cbr\u003e Business Environment and Internal Control Factors (BEICFs) \u003cbr\u003e Risk Control Selfâ€Assessment (RCSA) \u003cbr\u003e Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) \u003cbr\u003e Internal Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Losses are the financial impact associated with the operational event that is recorded in the financial statement. It includes \u003cbr\u003e Loss incurred, and \u003cbr\u003e Expenditure incurred to resume normal functioning, excluding opportunity costs and foregone revenue etc. \u003cbr\u003e Further, the Bank shall also track the potential loss, near misses, attempted frauds, etc. where no loss has actually been incurred by the Bank. Internal Loss Data is crucial for risk estimate of the Bank as it is linked with its own actual loss experience. \u003cbr\u003e Loss data information must be comprehensive consisting of gross loss amount, date of the event, recovery information, geographic location, related product/ process, business line, and loss event type. Comprehensive information of loss data facilitates analysis, investigation, monitoring, reporting and measurement of Operational Risk losses. Incident \u0026 Loss Data Management Framework is attached in Annexure 1. \u003cbr\u003e Following types of incidents are part of Operational Risk Incident \u0026 Loss Data framework and reported in Loss Data:Following types of incidents are part of Operational Risk Incident \u0026 Loss Data framework and reported in Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e Following types of incidents are part of Operational Risk Incident \u0026 Loss Data framework and reported in Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e Following types of incidents are part of Operational Risk Incident \u0026 Loss Data framework and reported in Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e All internal and external frauds. \u003cbr\u003e Penalty levied by Regulatory/ Statutory Bodies/ Incomeâ€Tax Authorities etc. \u003cbr\u003e Compensation awarded to customer/ staff / vendor by any court of law / ombudsman / consumer court etc. \u003cbr\u003e Litigation by staff / customer/ outsider initiated against the Bank, involving monetary claims against the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e Losses due to damage to physical assets (Vehicle, furniture \u0026 fixtures etc.) \u003cbr\u003e Loss of assets due to natural calamities (Rain, flood, earthquake etc.) \u003cbr\u003e Losses due to fire and other accidents. \u003cbr\u003e Losses due to staff negligence. \u003cbr\u003e Losses due to theft, burglary, dacoity, riot, arson, mob attacks etc. \u003cbr\u003e Direct or indirect losses on account of system malfunction. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Unrecovered amount of short recovery, inspection charges, documentation charges etc. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e External/ Overhead Expenses in legal issues, directly related to the events and fees paid to advocates/ advisors. \u003cbr\u003e Losses from Treasury Operations due to Operational errors \u003cbr\u003e Pending Losses â€“ Operational Risk losses which are temporary booked in suspense accounts and are yet to be recognized in Profit\u0026 Loss Account. (Exâ€ Impact of legal judgement and damage to physical asset). \u003cbr\u003e Nearâ€miss events such as attempted frauds, wrong transaction entries. \u003cbr\u003e Internal loss data shall be crucial for tying a bankâ€™s risk estimates to its actual loss experience. The tracking of internal loss event data shall be the essential prerequisite to the development and functioning of a credible operational risk measurement system. Apart from Internal Loss Data, Bank shall also track the potential loss (i.e., extent to which further loss may be incurred due to the same operational risk event), Near Misses/Attempted Frauds, External Loss etc., where no loss has actually been incurred by our bank, from the point of view of strengthening the internal systems and controls and avoiding the possibility of such events turning into actual operational risk losses in future. Owner Departments to track the Internal Loss, External Loss \u0026 Near Miss Events (Attempted Fraud) Data as per â€œIncident and Loss Management Frameworkâ€- Annexure - 1. \u003cbr\u003e Life Cycle of a loss event: \u003cbr\u003e Loss events can be categorized in: \u003cbr\u003e Event â€“ What happened? \u003cbr\u003e Cause â€“ Why did event happen? \u003cbr\u003e Effect â€“ What are the consequences? \u003cbr\u003e The analysis completes a cycle, when an event occurs, it is because of some causal factor and it has some financial or non â€financial effect. \u003cbr\u003e Diagrammatical representation of life cycle of an Operational Risk Loss \u003cbr\u003e Cause \u003cbr\u003e Inadequate Segregation of Duties \u003cbr\u003e Inadequate Security Measures \u003cbr\u003e Insufficient Training \u003cbr\u003e Event \u003cbr\u003e Internal Fraud \u003cbr\u003e External Fraud \u003cbr\u003e DamagetoPhysical Assets \u003cbr\u003e Effect \u003cbr\u003e Legal Liability \u003cbr\u003e Loss of Recourse \u003cbr\u003e Write Down \u003cbr\u003e Reputational Loss \u003cbr\u003e (ii)External Loss Data:(ii)External Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e (ii)External Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e (ii)External Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e 111794Collection and analysis of external loss data is an outward looking approach. By this means, Bank can proactively assess the impact of any major risk event occurred in industry or peer Bank and can analyse preparedness and any action taken by the Bank to mitigate such events. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Sources of External Loss Data: \u003cbr\u003e Public Loss Data: Public loss data contains loss data from sources such as newspapers, magazines, press releases, etc. \u003cbr\u003e Pooled Loss Data: Consortium or pooled databases contain non â€public data sourced from participating Banks / financial institutions etc. \u003cbr\u003e Scenario Analysis: \u003cbr\u003e Scenario Analysis is a forward looking approach. Scenarios are potential future events. Their evaluation involves answering two fundamental questions: firstly, what is the potential frequency of occurrence a particular scenario and secondly, what is its potential loss severity. It helps in anticipating changes in the business environment and knows whether a past event can repeat itself. \u003cbr\u003e Stress Testing: Stress testing serves as a central tool in identifying, measuring, and controlling risks for assessing the bankâ€™s resilience to stress events. It plays an important role in the communication of risk within the Bank in order to provide support for internal and regulatory capital adequacy assessments on a regular basis. These tests ensure that the Bank has enough capital to withstand losses in stress scenarios. \u003cbr\u003e Business Environment and Internal Control Factors (BEICFs): \u003cbr\u003e BEICFs are indicators of a Bankâ€™s Operational Risk profile that reflect underlying business risk factors and an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control environment. \u003cbr\u003e Risk and Controls Self-Assessment (RCSA): \u003cbr\u003e RCSA is a systematic process which leverages the collective knowledge of individuals within the Bank to proactively identify, assess, mitigate/control, monitor and report significant risks in the business functions of the bank after evaluation of operational risk drivers. \u003cbr\u003e RCSA provides a systematic means of identifying control gaps that threaten the achievement of defined business or process objectives and monitoring of what management is actually doing to minimize/close these gaps. It is a continuous process, so that resultant shift in the risk profile of a RCSA entity can easily be monitored and timely action can be taken. \u003cbr\u003e It is a technique / approach conducted by the persons actually involved in the performance of the business activities, hence ensures collective participation at bank wide level and assigns the accountability for the management of risk to people who own the risk as the first line of defence as per good risk governance structure. \u003cbr\u003e Quorum for conducting RCSA for new product/ process/ system:Quorum for conducting RCSA for new product/ process/ system: \u003cbr\u003e Quorum for conducting RCSA for new product/ process/ system: \u003cbr\u003e Quorum for conducting RCSA for new product/ process/ system: \u003cbr\u003e 111794The quorum for RCSA of new product/ process/ system shall be â€ 6 â€ members with mandatory presence of ORM Cell/Department or Risk Management Department. BORM/ORMS will facilitate the technical aspects of various assessments. In case of RCSA, the functional department will be the convener. The Functional Head of sponsoring department should preferably ensure the presence of working committee member of following departments: â€ \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Legal \u0026 RTI \u003cbr\u003e ","title":"Vigilance","id":21},{"content":"Fraud Risk Management \u003cbr\u003e ORM Cell/Department or Risk Management \u003cbr\u003e CBS \u003cbr\u003e Operations \u003cbr\u003e Preventive Vigilance \u003cbr\u003e ","title":"Fraud Risk Management","id":22},{"content":"Vigilance \u003cbr\u003e Other Verticals which have expertise in the related activities or where expertise of other department is required in the product or process under evaluation. The RCSA Committee shall put their views/ observation /suggestion before the PPAC/ORMC for their approval through the sponsoring department. \u003cbr\u003e It will be the responsibility of the proposing/sponsoring department to comprehensively identify all the risks thereof and provide a Risk and Control Matrix along with other documents required for risk review by the RCSA Committee. Proposing/Sponsoring Department to frame Risk and Control Matrix as per â€œRCSA Matrix Chartâ€ - Annexure - 4. \u003cbr\u003e Key Risk Indicators (KRI): Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) is a forward looking technique to sense the pulse of potential risk on a proâ€ active basis to enable the bank to take appropriate action in a timely manner. \u003cbr\u003e By monitoring a set of appropriate risk indicators and by checking their actual values and trends against agreed limits / thresholds, bank is able to see whether its operational risk exposures remain within its appetite for risk or exceeds it. \u003cbr\u003e KRI is linked to a specific risk which is measured on periodical basis. Changes in the value of the indicator are likely to be associated with changes in operational risk exposure or operational loss experience. \u003cbr\u003e Measurement of Operational Risk: There is no uniformity of approach in measurement of operational risk in the banking system. In the absence of any sophisticated models, bank should evolve simple benchmarks based on an aggregate measure of business activity such as revenue, fee income, operating cost, total assets adjusted for offâ€ balance sheet exposures or a combination of these variables. \u003cbr\u003e Mitigation of Operational Risk: \u003cbr\u003e 111794ORM Cell/Department or Risk Management Department will work closely with Internal Audit to plan assessment and concerns about risk in the Bank. Internal Audit will share information to minimize potential Operational Risk. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Bank Insurance Department \u0026 other department concerned will determine optimal Insurance limits and coverage to assure that the insurance policies the bank purchase are cost beneficial and align with the operational risk profile of the Bank. \u003cbr\u003e By communicating with business unit and staff about the importance of operational risk methodologies and tools including assessments, reporting and accordingly take necessary steps to mitigate risk. \u003cbr\u003e By ensuring that Bank is complying with Govt. regulations, instructions issued by regulatory bodies and internal directions. \u003cbr\u003e Preventive Vigilance department will serve as an effective tool for creating awareness among staff members leading to prevention of frauds at Branch level. \u003cbr\u003e An Internal mechanism â€œWhistle Blowerâ€ is established for staff members to report to the management, concerns about unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud or violation of the Bankâ€™s rule and regulations. \u003cbr\u003e Operational Risk Control /Mitigation: For all material operational risks that have been identified, the Bank will decide the appropriate risk treatment such as acceptance, reduction, avoidance or transfer. An appropriate risk treatment depends upon various factors such as: \u003cbr\u003e Nature of the risk \u003cbr\u003e Risk appetite of the Bank \u003cbr\u003e Business strategy \u003cbr\u003e Available risk measures with the Bank \u003cbr\u003e Cost / Benefit \u003cbr\u003e Regulatory requirements \u003cbr\u003e Commonly used risk control/ mitigation measures are: \u003cbr\u003e Internal Control System / Environment \u003cbr\u003e Insurance \u003cbr\u003e Outsourcing \u003cbr\u003e BCP / DRP \u003cbr\u003e The decision for outsourcing is not only for risk transfer but also driven by various other factors such as business strategy, cost reduction, leveraging the expertise in the market, concentration on core business activities etc. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Internal Control System / Environment: A system of effective internal controls is a critical component of the Bank management and a foundation for the safe and sound operation of banking organization and helps to ensure that the Bank will comply with laws and regulations as well as policies, plans, internal rules and procedures, and decrease the risk of unexpected losses or damage to the Bank\u0027s reputation. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Internal controls are typically embedded in Bank\u0027s dayâ€toâ€day business at all levels, and are designed to provide reasonable assurance about efficient and effective operations, safeguarding of assets, reliable information; timely complete and produce reliable financial reports, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. \u003cbr\u003e A sound internal control programme consists of five components that are integral to the risk management process: \u003cbr\u003e Risk assessment, \u003cbr\u003e Control environment, \u003cbr\u003e Control activities, \u003cbr\u003e Information and communication, \u003cbr\u003e Monitoring activities \u003cbr\u003e An effective internal control system in the Bank ensures Compliance with policies and procedures with: \u003cbr\u003e Topâ€level reviews of progress towards stated objectives; \u003cbr\u003e Verifying compliance with management controls; \u003cbr\u003e Review of the treatment and resolution of instances of nonâ€compliance; \u003cbr\u003e Evaluation of the required approvals and authorizations to ensure accountability to an appropriate level of management; and \u003cbr\u003e Tracking reports for approved exceptions to thresholds or limits, management overrides and other deviations from policy. \u003cbr\u003e Appropriate segregation of duties such that personnel are not assigned conflicting responsibilities. Areas of potential conflicts of interest are to be identified, minimized, and subject to careful independent monitoring and review. \u003cbr\u003e Clearly established authorities and/or processes for approval \u003cbr\u003e Close monitoring of adherence to assigned risk thresholds or limits \u003cbr\u003e Safeguards for access to, and use of, Bank assets and records \u003cbr\u003e Appropriate staffing level and training to maintain expertise \u003cbr\u003e Ongoing processes to identify business lines or products where returns appear to be out of line with reasonable expectations \u003cbr\u003e Regular verification and reconciliation of transactions and accounts \u003cbr\u003e Sound technology risk management on the same lines as the Bank\u0027s operational risk management framework. Effective use and sound implementation of technology contributes to the control environment as they are less prone to errors than manual processes, however, automated processes introduce risks that must be addressed through sound technology governance and infrastructure risk management programme. \u003cbr\u003e 111794A sound technology infrastructure in the Bank that meets current and longâ€term business requirements by providing sufficient capacity for normal activity levels as well as peaks during periods of market stress; ensuring data and system integrity, security, and availability; and supporting integrated and comprehensive risk management \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Risk transfer strategy e.g. through optimal insurance coverage. The decision to retain or selfâ€insure the risk will be consistent with the Bank\u0027s overall business strategy and appetite for risk. Since risk transfer is an imperfect substitute for sound controls and risk management programme, Bank\u0027s views risk transfer tools as complementary to, rather than a replacement for, thorough internal operational risk control. \u003cbr\u003e Reliable information systems that cover all significant activities of the Bank. These systems, including those that hold and use data in an electronic form, are secure, monitored independently and supported by adequate contingency arrangements. \u003cbr\u003e Effective channels of communication to ensure that all staff fully understand and adhere to policies and procedures affecting their duties and responsibilities and that other relevant information is reaching the appropriate personnel. \u003cbr\u003e Effective management of risk in outsourcing activities. \u003cbr\u003e Adequate BCP mechanism, their periodical review and testing to ensure the appropriateness. \u003cbr\u003e An effective internal audit / inspection function that independently evaluates the control systems within the organization. Internal audit / inspection is a part of the ongoing monitoring of the Bank\u0027s system of internal controls, provides an independent assessment of the adequacy of, and compliance with, the Bank\u0027s established policies and procedures. \u003cbr\u003e Insurance as Risk Mitigant: Insurance policies, particularly those with prompt and certain payâ€out features, can be used to externalize the risk of \"low frequency, high severity\" losses which may occur as a result of events such as third party claims resulting from errors and omissions, physical loss of securities, employee or thirdâ€ party fraud, and natural disasters \u003cbr\u003e The cost must be at a comparable level to the benefits to be obtained in case the risk covered materializes. A risk imposes a cost on the Bank and reducing that cost generates value. A decision to retain risk is appropriate when it is rewarded by an adequate economic return. An optimal insurance policy decision generates maximum value for the Bank. Bank will consider all these aspects and go for insurance based on the risk exposures, past experience, cost incurred/claim settled. \u003cbr\u003e Bank will follow guidelines issued by RBI/NABARD for insurance provider, term, notice period and exclusions and limitations of the insurance. \u003cbr\u003e Function / department responsible for deciding and managing insurance shall provide all the information, data, reports etc. for the effective management of operational risk. \u003cbr\u003e Outsourcing Risk Management: Outsourcing of activities can, inter alia, reduce the Bank\u0027s risk profile by transferring activities to others with greater expertise and scale to manage the risks associated with specialized business activities. Outsourcing of financial services to third party can reduce some risks but can also lead to new set of risks such as legal risk. The Bank\u0027s use of third parties does not diminish the responsibility of management to ensure that the thirdâ€party activity is conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Outsourcing arrangements is to be based on robust contracts and / or service level agreements that ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities between external service providers and the Bank.

This can, in turn, result in significant financial losses to the Bank, as well as broader disruptions to the financial system through channels such as the payments system. \u003cbr\u003e Bank has adopted policy on \u0027Business Continuity Planning\u0027 to ensure its ability to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. \u003cbr\u003e Independent Evaluation of Operational Risk Management by Audit and Review: Internal audit is part of the ongoing monitoring of the bank\u0027s system of internal controls because internal audit provides an independent assessment of the adequacy of, and compliance with, the bankâ€™s established policies and procedures. As such, the internal audit function assists senior management and the Board of Directors in the efficient and effective discharge of their responsibilities \u003cbr\u003e as described above.

It supports various sectors of the country by providing food grains to the growing population, supplies raw material to industries, generates purchasing power and demand for consumer goods in rural areas and also plays a significant role in exports. Agricultural credit is a critical resource support to farm sector in India, given the dependence of a large section of its population on agricultural activities. In the recent times, multiple challenges have led to stress in the agricultural sector, which also got manifested in episodes of untimely deaths of distressed farmers. Farm loan waiver is often suggested as a possible solution to such distress situations. \u003cbr\u003e Agriculture credit is an important prerequisite for agricultural growth. Agricultural policies have been reviewed from time to time to provide adequate and timely availability of finance to this sector. Rural credit system assumes importance because for most of the Indian rural families, savings are inadequate to finance farming and other economic activities. This coupled with the lack of simultaneity between income realization and expenditure and lumpiness of agricultural capital investments. The institutional credit system is critical for \u003cbr\u003e agricultural development and its role has further increased in the liberalized economic environment. In India a multi-agency approach comprising co-operative banks, scheduled commercial banks and regional rural banks (RRBs) has been followed to allow credit to agricultural sector. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Demand for credit to meet requirements of agriculture has increased considerably owing to use of modern technology, increase in use of fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides, increase in irrigation facilities, and increase in coverage under high yielding varieties program. Besides, it is also necessary to encourage activities allied to agriculture for increasing the income of poor farmers and providing full employment to them. In view of high importance of agriculture in Indian economy, efforts are being made by Reserve Bank of India, NABARD, Public Sector Banks and Government Agencies to increase the flow of bank credit to agriculture. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e 111794PRIORITY SECTOR LENDING â€“ GENERAL \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Evolution of Agricultural Finance in India and Policy Milestones \u003cbr\u003e Sr. \u003cbr\u003e No. \u003cbr\u003e Year \u003cbr\u003e Particulars \u003cbr\u003e 1. \u003cbr\u003e 1967 \u003cbr\u003e The Scheme of social control over banks was initiated in December 1967, \u003cbr\u003e to ensure equitable distribution of credit \u003cbr\u003e 2. \u003cbr\u003e 1968 \u003cbr\u003e The National Credit Council was set up mainly to periodically assess the demand for bank credit from various sectors of the economy and to determine the priorities for grant of loans and advances having regard to the availability of resources \u003cbr\u003e 3. \u003cbr\u003e 1974 \u003cbr\u003e Public sector banks were advised that their priority sector lending should reach a level of not less than one-third of their outstanding credit by March 1979 \u003cbr\u003e 4. \u003cbr\u003e 1978 \u003cbr\u003e Private Sector banks were also advised to and lend at least one-third of their total advances to the priority sector by the end of March 1980 \u003cbr\u003e 5. \u003cbr\u003e 1980 \u003cbr\u003e It is decided that banks should raise the proportion of their advances to priority sector to 40 per cent by March 1985. \u003cbr\u003e 6. \u003cbr\u003e 1982 \u003cbr\u003e Working Group (Shri A.

PERSPECTIVES \u003cbr\u003e VIGILANCE PERSPECTIVES \u003cbr\u003e VIGILANCE PERSPECTIVES \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance is a proactive and preventive management function, not merely a police or administrative chore. Its primary aim is to foster higher morality and rationality in public service. The success of \u003cbr\u003e vigilance is measured by its effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices, not by the number of cases detected and punished. \u003cbr\u003e The need for a vigilance function arises from the existence of codified conduct and discipline rules within an organization, which must be enforced. Rather than diminishing efficiency, vigilance activities are intended to enhance managerial effectiveness. Not every loss to an organization, whether financial or otherwise, warrants a vigilance inquiry; instead, it is judged by whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision under the prevailing circumstances. If the answer is positive, it \u003cbr\u003e 111794suggests bona fides, or good faith. Actions that do not involve a vigilance angle are handled through standard disciplinary procedures. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e A crucial positive aspect of vigilance is its role in protecting honest employees from harassment and false complaints. \u003cbr\u003e Preventive vigilance, which focuses on creating awareness about probity and ethical conduct, is considered an effective management tool to reduce corruption. \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance is a comprehensive function, and all employees have a duty to report deficiencies and suggest improvements. Employees should not simply view irregularities as a matter for the vigilance department alone. The vigilance department should be seen as an aid to management, helping to improve \u003cbr\u003e managerial and financial practices, rather than an inconvenient critic. It is an evolving system that adapts to changing commercial practices. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and AnswersObjective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e Question 1: The success of vigilance functions is primarily judged by: \u003cbr\u003e The number of cases detected and punished. \u003cbr\u003e The effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices. \u003cbr\u003e The increase in managerial efficiency. \u003cbr\u003e The number of complaints received. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) The effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices.Answer: B) The effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) The effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) The effectiveness in preventing unhealthy practices. \u003cbr\u003e Question 2: What is a key criterion for determining the \"bona fides\" of an official\u0027s decision? \u003cbr\u003e Whether the decision resulted in a financial loss. \u003cbr\u003e Whether the decision was made with a negative intent. \u003cbr\u003e Whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision. \u003cbr\u003e Whether the decision violated any service rules. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision.Answer: C) Whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Whether a person of common prudence would have made the same decision. \u003cbr\u003e Question 3: Vigilance is described as being an integral part of which function? \u003cbr\u003e The police function. \u003cbr\u003e The administrative chore. \u003cbr\u003e The managerial function. \u003cbr\u003e The financial audit function. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) The managerial function.Answer: C) The managerial function. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) The managerial function. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) The managerial function. \u003cbr\u003e Question 4: What is the positive role of vigilance in relation to employees? \u003cbr\u003e 111794To punish all dishonest employees. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e To protect honest employees from motivated complaints and harassment. \u003cbr\u003e To identify all acts of omission and commission. \u003cbr\u003e To handle all lapses, including those without a vigilance angle. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) To protect honest employees from motivated complaints and harassment.Answer: B) To protect honest employees from motivated complaints and harassment. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) To protect honest employees from motivated complaints and harassment. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) To protect honest employees from motivated complaints and harassment. \u003cbr\u003e Question 5: What is \"preventive vigilance\" aimed at achieving? \u003cbr\u003e Detecting and punishing corrupt practices after they occur. \u003cbr\u003e Reducing corruption by creating awareness about probity. \u003cbr\u003e Handling all administrative lapses under service rules. \u003cbr\u003e Limiting the scope of the vigilance department. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Reducing corruption by creating awareness about probity.Answer: B) Reducing corruption by creating awareness about probity. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Reducing corruption by creating awareness about probity. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Reducing corruption by creating awareness about probity. \u003cbr\u003e Principles of Natural Justice and Reasonable Opportunity \u003cbr\u003e The Principles of Natural Justice (PNJ) are a set of procedural guidelines followed by authorities when deciding disputes, especially when no formal rules exist. These principles are considered vital for ensuring justice and protecting employees facing disciplinary action. PNJ are not a single concept but rather a collection of principles that serve as basic guidelines for all disciplinary proceedings. Their interpretation is not static and evolves over time. They are recognized under the constitution and should govern departmental inquiries. \u003cbr\u003e The two main maxims of PNJ, derived from English law, are: \u003cbr\u003e 111794Audi Alteram Partem (Hear the Other Side): This maxim means no one should be condemned without being heard. A person must be informed of the allegations against them and given a reasonable opportunity to present their defense. A precise, unambiguous notice is the first prerequisite. The accused must also have the opportunity to contradict any evidence or statements made against them. Without a proper notice and opportunity to present one\u0027s case, the resulting order is invalid. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Nemo Debet Esse Judex in Propria Causa (No One Should Be a Judge in His Own Cause): This principle mandates that the adjudicating authority must not have a direct or indirect interest in the case or any bias. The decision cannot be made in good faith if the person is a judge in their own cause because justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. An impartial inquiry officer is essential to inspire confidence in the process. A judgment made against a party without proper notice or opportunity to appear is flawed. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e Question 1: What are the two main maxims of the Principles of Natural Justice recognized in English law? \u003cbr\u003e Prima facie and res judicata \u003cbr\u003e Audi alteram partem and nemo debet esse judex in propria causa \u003cbr\u003e Habeas corpus and mandamus \u003cbr\u003e Stare decisis and obiter dicta \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Audi alteram partem and nemo debet esse judex in propria causa. Question 2: The principle of audi alteram partem means: \u003cbr\u003e A person must be guilty until proven innocent. \u003cbr\u003e No one should be a judge in their own cause. \u003cbr\u003e Justice must be done in secret. \u003cbr\u003e No one should be condemned unheard. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: D) No one should be condemned unheard. \u003cbr\u003e Question 3: What is the first prerequisite of the audi alteram partem principle? \u003cbr\u003e An oral warning \u003cbr\u003e An official apology \u003cbr\u003e A precise and unambiguous notice \u003cbr\u003e A financial penalty \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) A precise and unambiguous notice. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Question 4: According to the provided text, what is the consequence of an absence of notice or opportunity to represent a case? \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e The accused is automatically found guilty. \u003cbr\u003e The order is rendered invalid. \u003cbr\u003e The case is dismissed with a warning. \u003cbr\u003e The authority can proceed without the accused. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) The order is rendered invalid. \u003cbr\u003e Question 5: The maxim nemo debet esse judex in propria causa primarily deals with the requirement of: \u003cbr\u003e An orderly course of procedure. \u003cbr\u003e Avoiding financial interest in the case. \u003cbr\u003e Impartiality and lack of bias of the judge. \u003cbr\u003e Allowing a person to produce their defense. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C) Impartiality and lack of bias of the judge. \u003cbr\u003e Question 6: The principle that \"justice must not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly seem to be done\" is associated with which maxim? \u003cbr\u003e Audi alteram partem \u003cbr\u003e Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa \u003cbr\u003e Both A and B \u003cbr\u003e Neither A nor B \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B) Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa. \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 3: Vigilance MachineryChapter 3: Vigilance Machinery \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 3: Vigilance Machinery \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 3: Vigilance Machinery \u003cbr\u003e The vigilance mechanism in banks, which involves the \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance setup in a bank, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), and the Chief Technical Examiner\u0027s Organization (CTEO). \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance Setup in the BankVigilance Setup in the Bank \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance Setup in the Bank \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance Setup in the Bank \u003cbr\u003e Vigilance Officer (VO), typically a Chief Manager, manages the vigilance functions within a bank.

The CBI has 11 divisions, including the \u003cbr\u003e Bank Securities and Fraud Cell (BS \u0026 FC). The BS \u0026 FC has dedicated branches in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata, each with specific territorial jurisdiction. \u003cbr\u003e The CBI handles significant or complicated cases involving bribery, corruption, forgery, cheating, and criminal breach of trust, as well as cases with interstate or international ramifications or those requiring expert investigation. Cases of financial fraud involving â‚¹6 crore or more are referred to the CBI, while those below this amount are referred to the local police. The chapter also details the procedures for filing police complaints for fraudulent transactions, including interâ€sol transactions under the CBS environment. \u003cbr\u003e The document specifies two types of cases the CBI can register: \u003cbr\u003e A Preliminary Enquiry (PE) to verify information before formal investigation, and a Regular Case (RC) when a cognizable offense is clearly made out. It also outlines the requirement for banks to cooperate fully with the CBI during investigations, including providing records and transferring or suspending employees when requested. \u003cbr\u003e The CBI recommends one of several courses of action in its reports, including prosecution, regular departmental action for major or minor penalties, or no action. The document provides a detailed procedure for handling prosecution sanctions, noting that the bank must decide within \u003cbr\u003e 30 days whether to grant or decline the sanction. Disagreements with CBI recommendations are referred to the CVC. \u003cbr\u003e Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) \u003cbr\u003e Established in 1964 based on the recommendations of the \u003cbr\u003e Santhanam Committee, the CVC was given statutory status in 2003 with the passing of the CVC Act, 2003. The Commission consists of a Central Vigilance Commissioner and up to two Vigilance Commissioners, appointed for a fourâ€year term or until they turn 65. \u003cbr\u003e The CVC\u0027s functions include: \u003cbr\u003e Supervising the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) regarding corruptionâ€related investigations. \u003cbr\u003e Directing DSPE on investigations. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Conducting inquiries into complaints against public servants. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Reviewing the progress of prosecution sanctions and investigations. \u003cbr\u003e Providing advice to the government and public sector organizations on vigilance matters. \u003cbr\u003e The CVC\u0027s advice is required for vigilance cases involving officers in Scale V and above. The advice is sought at two stages: \u003cbr\u003e First Stage Advice on the type of disciplinary proceedings to initiate, and Second Stage Advice on the quantum of punishment or exoneration. The document outlines the required documents for both stages. It also notes that if the bank disagrees with the CVC\u0027s advice, the matter is referred to the Chairman for a final decision. Cases of nonâ€acceptance or nonâ€consultation with the CVC are reported in its Annual Report, which is presented to Parliament. \u003cbr\u003e An Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), consisting of three Chief Managers and one Regional Head, determines if there\u0027s a vigilance angle in complaints or disciplinary cases in the banking sector. \u003cbr\u003e Chief Technical Examiner\u0027s Organization (CTEO) \u003cbr\u003e The CTEO was established in 1957 for technical audits and was later transferred to the CVC in 1964.

The Act consolidated previous laws, including the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, to strengthen antiâ€corruption measures. It came into force on September 9, 1988, and repealed the corresponding sections of the older acts. \u003cbr\u003e Key Provisions and Offenses \u003cbr\u003e The PC Act, 1988, defines and punishes a variety of corruptionâ€related offenses committed by or in relation to public servants. The document provides a table listing offenses and their corresponding sections under the older and newer acts. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 Examples of Offenses: \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Taking of bribe by a public servant (Section 7). \u003cbr\u003e Taking gratification to influence a public servant by corrupt or illegal means (Section 8). \u003cbr\u003e Public servant obtaining a valuable thing without sufficient consideration from someone involved in their official business (Section 11). \u003cbr\u003e Criminal misconduct, which includes: \u003cbr\u003e Habitually taking bribes. \u003cbr\u003e Dishonesty or fraudulent misappropriation. \u003cbr\u003e Possession of disproportionate assets to known sources of income. \u003cbr\u003e Possessing disproportionate assets is a \"substantive offense\" if the public servant cannot provide a satisfactory explanation.

A charge sheet is a critical document in departmental inquiries, as it ensures an employee is given a fair opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of misconduct. \u003cbr\u003e 1. General Principles of a Charge Sheet1. General Principles of a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 1. General Principles of a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 1. General Principles of a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e A charge sheet is a fundamental requirement of natural justice. It is issued to an employee when a decision is made to conduct a departmental inquiry. The disciplinary proceedings officially begin with the issuance of this document. Without a charge sheet, any subsequent punishment order is considered invalid. \u003cbr\u003e While it may seem beneficial to ask for an explanation from the employee before issuing a charge sheet, it\u0027s not a mandatory step. The purpose of seeking an explanation beforehand is to potentially avoid the need for a full inquiry if the explanation is satisfactory. \u003cbr\u003e The authority to issue a charge sheet rests with the employer. This power is typically delegated to the Disciplinary Authority, who is an officer competent to impose a penalty or dismiss an employee. If an unauthorized person frames the charges, the entire process is legally flawed. It\u0027s important to note that an authority can issue a charge sheet even if they are biased, as this does not affect their power to initiate the process. \u003cbr\u003e 2. Drafting a Charge Sheet2. Drafting a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 2. Drafting a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 2. Drafting a Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e A properly drafted charge sheet is the cornerstone of any disciplinary case. It must be prepared with utmost accuracy and precision, based on the facts gathered during the investigation. The charges must be specific and detailed, leaving no room for ambiguity. \u003cbr\u003e Key Elements of a Well-Drafted Charge Sheet:Key Elements of a Well-Drafted Charge Sheet: \u003cbr\u003e Key Elements of a Well-Drafted Charge Sheet: \u003cbr\u003e Key Elements of a Well-Drafted Charge Sheet: \u003cbr\u003e Clarity and Specificity: Charges should be clear and not vague. The test of a valid charge is whether it allows the employee to understand the exact nature of the offense and prepare a proper defence. Vague charges can invalidate the entire inquiry unless the employee, by their actions (e.g., participating in the inquiry without protest), shows they understood the allegations. \u003cbr\u003e Inclusion of Essential Elements: If a misconduct is defined by specific conditions (e.g., \"wilful\" disobedience or \"gross\" negligence), those words must be included in the charge. Similarly, if a misconduct is habitual, the word \"habitual\" is essential. \u003cbr\u003e Details: The charge sheet should include specific details such as the date, time, and place of the incident. It should also, if possible, quantify any loss directly attributable to the employee\u0027s actions. When misconduct involves spoken or written words (e.g., defamation), the actual words or a substantial reproduction must be included. \u003cbr\u003e Multiple Misconducts: An employee can be charged with more than one misconduct simultaneously for a single set of allegations. If the allegations could constitute one misconduct or another, depending on the circumstances, the charge can be framed in the alternative. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Language: The charge sheet must be in a language the employee can easily understand. For subordinate staff, this often means using the local vernacular. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Tone: The language should not imply that the employee is already guilty. A charge sheet is merely a statement of unproven allegations. \u003cbr\u003e Accompanying Documents: A charge sheet must be accompanied by a statement of allegations, a list of reliedâ€upon documents, and a list of witnesses. Copies of these documents and witness statements should also be provided to the employee. \u003cbr\u003e 3. Amendment and Delay3. Amendment and Delay \u003cbr\u003e 3. Amendment and Delay \u003cbr\u003e 3. Amendment and Delay \u003cbr\u003e The Disciplinary Authority has the power to amend, withdraw, or add new charges. However, an Inquiry Authority or Inquiry Officer, who is typically an entrusted third party, cannot frame new charges on their own, as that power belongs to the Disciplinary Authority. \u003cbr\u003e Delay in issuing a charge sheet can be a serious issue. While a slight delay is not necessarily fatal, an inordinate or inexplicable delay can be grounds for quashing the charge sheet, as it can be seen as a denial of a reasonable opportunity to the employee. The burden of proving that the delay was due to a reasonable cause fall on the department. Delay can occur due to ignorance of the facts, ongoing preliminary investigation, or other circumstances. \u003cbr\u003e 4. Service of the Charge Sheet4. Service of the Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 4. Service of the Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e 4. Service of the Charge Sheet \u003cbr\u003e Proper service of the charge sheet is a prerequisite for a valid departmental inquiry. If it is proven that the charge sheet was not served, the subsequent proceedings are invalid. \u003cbr\u003e Methods of Service:Methods of Service: \u003cbr\u003e Methods of Service: \u003cbr\u003e Methods of Service: \u003cbr\u003e Personal Service: The most common method is personal delivery, where the employee signs an office copy or a hand delivery book. Getting a signature on the office copy is preferred as it conclusively proves the identity of the document served. \u003cbr\u003e Registered Post: If personal delivery is not possible (e.g., the employee refuses to accept it), the charge sheet should be sent by Registered Post with A.D. (Acknowledgement Due). The \u003cbr\u003e endorsement \"refused\" by postal authorities is considered proof of service. \u003cbr\u003e Publication: In extreme cases where an employee is deliberately avoiding service, the Supreme Court has indicated that publishing the notice in a local newspaper with a wide circulation can be considered valid service, provided repeated attempts at personal and postal service have \u003cbr\u003e failed. \u003cbr\u003e Simply posting the charge sheet on a notice board is not considered valid service on its own, but it can be used as an additional precaution. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions and Answers \u003cbr\u003e 111794What is one of the fundamental rules of natural justice related to the charge sheet? \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e The employee must be suspended immediately. \u003cbr\u003e The employee must have a show cause notice before a charge sheet is issued. \u003cbr\u003e The employee must be given a full and true disclosure of the facts against them. \u003cbr\u003e The inquiry must be completed within a week. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: c) The employee must be given a full and true disclosure of the facts against them. \u003cbr\u003e Who has the power to issue a charge sheet to an employee? \u003cbr\u003e The Inquiry Authority/Officer. \u003cbr\u003e Any officer senior to the employee. \u003cbr\u003e The Disciplinary Authority. \u003cbr\u003e The human resources department head. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: c) The Disciplinary Authority. \u003cbr\u003e What is the consequence of a charge being \"vague\"? \u003cbr\u003e It can be rectified by the Inquiry Officer. \u003cbr\u003e It can be ignored if the employee participates in the inquiry without protest. \u003cbr\u003e It is a fatal defect that can vitiate the entire proceedings. \u003cbr\u003e It automatically leads to the dismissal of the case. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: c) It is a fatal defect that can vitiate the entire proceedings. \u003cbr\u003e What must be included in a charge sheet if a misconduct is defined as \"wilful\" or \"gross\"? \u003cbr\u003e The specific section of the penal code. \u003cbr\u003e The words \"wilful\" or \"gross\". \u003cbr\u003e A letter of apology from the employee. \u003cbr\u003e A show cause notice. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: b) The words \"wilful\" or \"gross\". \u003cbr\u003e A properly drafted charge sheet should be written in which language? \u003cbr\u003e English only. \u003cbr\u003e The language of the disciplinary authority. \u003cbr\u003e A language the employee can easily understand. \u003cbr\u003e 111794The official language of the state. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Answer: c) A language the employee can easily understand. \u003cbr\u003e What is the role of an Inquiry Authority/Officer concerning a charge sheet? \u003cbr\u003e They can issue a new charge sheet. \u003cbr\u003e They can amend or add charges. \u003cbr\u003e They cannot frame new charges. \u003cbr\u003e They are responsible for drafting the initial charge sheet. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: c) They cannot frame new charges. \u003cbr\u003e In the context of serving a charge sheet, what is the legal presumption if a registered letter is returned with the endorsement \"refused\"? \u003cbr\u003e It amounts to nonâ€service. \u003cbr\u003e It amounts to valid service. \u003cbr\u003e It means the charge sheet is invalid. \u003cbr\u003e It requires an oral explanation from the employee. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: b) It amounts to valid service. \u003cbr\u003e Chapter VII: Suspension \u003cbr\u003e General Understanding of Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e Suspension is a temporary deprivation of an employee\u0027s office or position. It is considered an \u003cbr\u003e administrative action, not a penalty. While suspended, an employee still holds a lien on their permanent post and does not suffer a reduction in rank. \u003cbr\u003e The Disciplinary Authority considers suspending an employee when misconduct comes to light, particularly during an investigation, disciplinary proceedings, or a pending criminal prosecution. \u003cbr\u003e Circumstances Justifying Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e 111794An employee may be suspended in the following situations: \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Prejudice to Investigation: If the employee\u0027s presence in the office could jeopardize an investigation, trial, or inquiry, for example, by tampering with witnesses or documents. \u003cbr\u003e Subverting Discipline: If the employee\u0027s continued presence is likely to seriously undermine discipline in their workplace. \u003cbr\u003e Wider Public Interest: If their continuance in office is against public interest, such as in cases of public scandal involving corruption, where suspension is necessary to demonstrate the bank\u0027s strict policy against such acts. \u003cbr\u003e Prima Facie Case: If a preliminary inquiry or investigation reveals a prima facie case that could lead to criminal or departmental proceedings, potentially resulting in conviction, dismissal, removal, or compulsory retirement. \u003cbr\u003e Prejudicial Activities: When an employee is suspected of engaging in activities harmful to the bank\u0027s interests, such as leaking confidential or false information or violating the oath of secrecy. \u003cbr\u003e Illustrations of Misconducts Leading to Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e Some examples of misconduct where suspension may be appropriate include: \u003cbr\u003e Moral Turpitude: Misconduct involving moral turpitude. \u003cbr\u003e Financial Misdeeds: Corruption, embezzlement, misappropriation of bank funds, possession of disproportionate assets, or misuse of official power for personal gain. \u003cbr\u003e Negligence: Serious negligence or dereliction of duties that result in significant financial loss to the bank. \u003cbr\u003e Refusal of Duty: Desertion of duties or deliberate refusal to follow orders from a superior officer. \u003cbr\u003e Authority and Procedure for Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e Competent Authority: The Disciplinary Authorities are the competent authorities for issuing suspension orders. These orders take effect from the date they are made. \u003cbr\u003e Consultation: Disciplinary Authorities may consult with the Chief Vigilance Officer for vigilanceâ€ related suspensions and when necessary for nonâ€vigilance matters. \u003cbr\u003e Alternative to Suspension: Before suspending an employee, the competent authority should consider if the purpose could be served by transferring the official to a nonâ€sensitive post or a different location. If a transfer is not feasible, the authority must record the reasons for proceeding with suspension. \u003cbr\u003e Multiple Cases: If an employee is already suspended for one case and a new case arises, a fresh suspension order should be issued specifically for the new case. This ensures the employee can remain suspended for the new case even if the first case is resolved. \u003cbr\u003e 111794CBI Recommendations: In cases where the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recommends suspension, and the Competent Authority disagrees, the matter should be referred to the Commission for advice. Similarly, if a suspension order was based on CBI advice, the CBI should be consulted before revoking it. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Hardship and Timeliness of Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e Suspension, though not a punishment, causes great hardship to an employee, a fact emphasized by the Central Vigilance Commission and the courts. Therefore, utmost care and caution must be exercised before implementing it. The disciplinary authority should strive to keep the suspension period as short as possible. Investigations and disciplinary proceedings should be completed speedily. \u003cbr\u003e Review and Revocation of Suspension: \u003cbr\u003e Periodic Review: Competent Authorities are required to review all suspension cases quarterly \u003cbr\u003e (March, June, September, and December). \u003cbr\u003e Release from Custody: If an official is released from police custody without prosecution, their case must be reviewed within 30 days to consider revoking the suspension. \u003cbr\u003e Charge Sheet: To minimize the suspension period, a charge sheet should be filed in court or served to the employee within three months of suspension. \u003cbr\u003e Revocation: Suspension can be revoked if the Competent Authority is convinced there\u0027s a valid reason to do so. Reasons for revocation include: \u003cbr\u003e No formal proceedings are needed. \u003cbr\u003e The employee is exonerated of the charges. \u003cbr\u003e The penalty awarded is not dismissal, removal, or compulsory retirement. \u003cbr\u003e A court investigation doesn\u0027t reveal a prima facie case of an offense. \u003cbr\u003e The employee is acquitted in a trial court or a higher court appeal/revision. \u003cbr\u003e Subsistence Allowance: \u003cbr\u003e During suspension, an employee is entitled to a subsistence allowance. \u003cbr\u003e For Officers: \u003cbr\u003e First three months: \u003cbr\u003e one-third (1/3) of the basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e Subsequent period (departmental inquiry): \u003cbr\u003e one-half (1/2) of the basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e Subsequent period (outside agency inquiry): \u003cbr\u003e one-third (1/3) of basic pay for the next three months, then one-half (1/2) for the remaining period. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Allowances: Dearness Allowance and other allowances (except special allowance) are calculated on the reduced pay. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e For Employees: \u003cbr\u003e First three months: \u003cbr\u003e one-third (1/3) of basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e Subsequent period (departmental inquiry): \u003cbr\u003e one-half (1/2) of basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e After one year: Full pay if the delay is not attributable to the employee. \u003cbr\u003e Deductions from Subsistence Allowance: \u003cbr\u003e Compulsory: Income Tax, Professional Tax, courtâ€ordered recoveries, loan/advance recoveries, and charges for housing/furniture. \u003cbr\u003e Optional: Insurance premiums and coâ€operative society dues. \u003cbr\u003e Not Permitted: No deductions for Provident Fund should be made. \u003cbr\u003e Other Important Aspects: \u003cbr\u003e Headquarters: The suspended employee\u0027s headquarters is normally their last place of duty, and they cannot leave without prior written permission. \u003cbr\u003e Promotion: An officer under suspension is subject to the Sealed Cover Procedure for promotion. \u003cbr\u003e Resignation: An employee under suspension for a grave offense should not normally have their resignation accepted. Disciplinary proceedings are considered pending until a final order is passed. \u003cbr\u003e Superannuation: If an officer reaches superannuation while disciplinary proceedings are pending, they will cease to be in service but the proceedings will continue. They will not receive pay or retirement benefits (except their own CPF contributions) until the proceedings are concluded. \u003cbr\u003e Death during Suspension: If a suspended employee dies before the conclusion of disciplinary proceedings, the proceedings are annulled, and the suspension is treated as if it never happened, with adjustments for subsistence allowance already paid. \u003cbr\u003e Objective Questions \u0026 Answers \u003cbr\u003e What is the effect of an order of \"Suspension\"? \u003cbr\u003e A) Permanent removal from a post. \u003cbr\u003e B) A temporary deprivation of an employee\u0027s office or position. \u003cbr\u003e 111794C) Reduction in rank and pay. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e D) A final penalty for misconduct. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B \u003cbr\u003e Suspension is considered a: \u003cbr\u003e A) Penalty. \u003cbr\u003e B) Disciplinary action. \u003cbr\u003e C) Administrative action. \u003cbr\u003e D) Punishment. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e Under what circumstance might an employee\u0027s suspension be considered against the wider public interest? \u003cbr\u003e A) When they are transferred to a nonâ€sensitive post. \u003cbr\u003e B) If they refuse to follow orders from a superior. \u003cbr\u003e C) If there is a public scandal directly alleging corruption. \u003cbr\u003e D) When they are a member of a coâ€operative society. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e Which of the following is NOT an illustration of misconduct where it may be desirable to suspend an employee? \u003cbr\u003e A) Misconduct involving moral turpitude. \u003cbr\u003e B) Misappropriation of Bank\u0027s funds. \u003cbr\u003e C) Possession of assets proportionate to their income. \u003cbr\u003e D) Desertion of duties. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e Who is the competent authority to pass orders of suspension? \u003cbr\u003e A) The Chief Vigilance Officer. \u003cbr\u003e B) The General Manager. \u003cbr\u003e C) The Disciplinary Authorities. \u003cbr\u003e D) The CBI. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e 111794Before suspending an employee, what alternative action should the competent authority consider? \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e A) Seeking advice from the CBI. \u003cbr\u003e B) Placing them under a sealed cover procedure. \u003cbr\u003e C) Transferring the official to a distant or nonâ€sensitive post. \u003cbr\u003e D) Immediately filing a charge sheet. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e How often are cases of suspension required to be reviewed by the Competent Authorities? \u003cbr\u003e A) Annually. \u003cbr\u003e B) Every quarter. \u003cbr\u003e C) Every month. \u003cbr\u003e D) Only when the employee appeals. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: B \u003cbr\u003e What is the subsistence allowance for an officer during the first three months of suspension? \u003cbr\u003e A) Full basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e B) Oneâ€half (1/2) of the basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e C) Oneâ€third (1/3) of the basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e D) Twoâ€thirds (2/3) of the basic pay. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e Which of the following is considered a compulsory deduction from a suspended employee\u0027s subsistence allowance? \u003cbr\u003e A) Insurance premiums. \u003cbr\u003e B) Dues of a coâ€operative society. \u003cbr\u003e C) Income Tax. \u003cbr\u003e D) Provident Fund contributions. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e What happens if a suspended employee dies before the disciplinary proceedings are concluded? \u003cbr\u003e A) The proceedings continue against their estate. \u003cbr\u003e B) Their family must repay the subsistence allowance. \u003cbr\u003e 111794C) The disciplinary proceedings are annulled and the suspension is treated as if it never happened. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e D) The suspension is automatically converted into a dismissal. \u003cbr\u003e Answer: C \u003cbr\u003e Chapter 8 - Disciplinary Proceedings \u003cbr\u003e General Concepts \u003cbr\u003e Discipline: Discipline is an orderly and systematic behavior in an organization that aligns with its rules. A disciplined employee works willingly according to established norms and cooperates with others to achieve organizational goals. \u003cbr\u003e Indiscipline: Deviation from the established codes of behavior (set by mutual understanding, custom, contract, or statute) is considered an act of indiscipline. \u003cbr\u003e Misconduct: In simple terms, misconduct is bad conduct that is inconsistent with the express or implied conditions of service. It generally involves some form of ill motive. \u003cbr\u003e Disciplinary Action: This is a course of action taken to maintain and regulate discipline within an organization according to accepted norms and rules of conduct for employees. \u003cbr\u003e Disciplinary Rules: Employee Conduct \u003cbr\u003e The document outlines a comprehensive set of rules for officers and employees, focusing on their conduct and obligations to the Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank. \u003cbr\u003e Service and Duties: Every officer or employee is a fullâ€time professional at the disposal of the Bank. They must perform duties necessary for the Bank\u0027s normal work and abide by all regulations and orders from their superiors. \u003cbr\u003e Confidentiality: Employees must maintain strict secrecy about the Bank\u0027s affairs and its constituents, not divulging confidential information unless ordered by a judicial or quasiâ€judicial authority or a superior officer in writing. \u003cbr\u003e Bank\u0027s Interest: Employees must serve the Bank honestly and faithfully, promoting its interests and showing courtesy to government officers and customers. \u003cbr\u003e External Activities: \u003cbr\u003e Press, Radio, etc.: Employees cannot, without prior sanction from the Competent Authority, own, edit, or manage a newspaper or other periodical. They also cannot participate in broadcasts, contribute articles, or publish official information without permission. Sanction is not needed for purely literary, artistic, or academic publications. \u003cbr\u003e Outside Employment: Employees cannot accept any outside employment, business, or office without prior sanction. Honorary social or charitable work is permitted as long as it does not affect official duties, but it must be discontinued if directed by the Competent Authority. An employee must report if a family member is involved in a business and cannot canvass for it. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Attendance and Absence: \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Employees cannot be absent from duties without permission. Absence without leave or overstaying leave means no pay or allowances for that period and may lead to disciplinary action. The Competent Authority can condone and regularize such absence if it was due to circumstances beyond the employee\u0027s control. \u003cbr\u003e Employees cannot remain absent from their headquarters overnight without prior sanction. \u003cbr\u003e Prohibited Acts: \u003cbr\u003e Gifts and Dowry: Employees cannot solicit or accept gifts from a Bank constituent or a subordinate. They are also prohibited from giving, taking, or abetting dowry. \u003cbr\u003e Speculation: Employees must not speculate in stocks, shares, or commodities. Frequent buying or selling is considered speculation. \u003cbr\u003e Lending/Borrowing: Employees cannot borrow from or place themselves under a pecuniary obligation to a broker, money lender, or subordinate. They cannot lend money to a Bank constituent in a private capacity or guarantee another person\u0027s obligations without permission. \u003cbr\u003e Indebtedness: Employees must manage their private affairs to avoid insolvency or habitual indebtedness. An employee is considered \"in debt\" if their unsecured liabilities exceed 12 months\u0027 substantive pay. Failure to liquidate debts in a reasonable time or making a false statement about their position can lead to dismissal. \u003cbr\u003e Property and Marriage: \u003cbr\u003e Property: New officers must submit a return of assets and liabilities upon appointment. All officers must submit an annual property return. They need prior intimation or sanction from the Competent Authority to acquire or dispose of immovable or movable property, especially if the transaction is with a person having official dealings or is not through a regular dealer. \u003cbr\u003e Marriage: An employee cannot marry a person with a living spouse, or marry a person if they have a living spouse. Permission can be granted if the marriage is permissible under personal law and other grounds exist. Employees must also report if they marry a nonâ€ Indian national. \u003cbr\u003e Criminal Charges and Politics: \u003cbr\u003e Criminal Charge: An employee arrested on a criminal charge or detained may be treated as being under suspension. They may be dismissed or face other penalties if committed to prison for debt or convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude or one that affects their Bank duties. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Politics: Employees cannot participate in politics or political demonstrations or contest elections. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Harassment: No employee shall commit any act that amounts to sexual harassment of women at the workplace, which includes physical contact, requests for sexual favors, and showing pornography. \u003cbr\u003e Disciplinary Proceedings Process \u003cbr\u003e Authorities: \u003cbr\u003e Disciplinary Authority (DA): The authority competent to take disciplinary action and impose penalties for misconduct. DAs, Appellate Authorities, and Competent Authorities are appointed by the Bank\u0027s Board of Directors. \u003cbr\u003e Enquiry Officer (EO) / Inquiring Authority (IA): An authority appointed by the DA to conduct enquiry proceedings. The EO\u0027s functions are quasiâ€judicial, and they must be independent and objective, adhering to principles of natural justice. After submitting the inquiry report, the EO becomes functus officio. \u003cbr\u003e Presenting Officer (PO): Appointed by the DA to present the case in support of the charges. The PO\u0027s job is to prove the allegations based on a \"preponderance of probability\". The PO\u0027s job is one of prosecution, unlike the judicial role of the EO. An Investigating Officer should not be appointed as a PO. \u003cbr\u003e Defence Representative (DR): Nominated by the Charged Officer (CO) / Charged Employee (CE) to plead their case. The DR can ask to inspect documents and crossâ€ examine witnesses. \u003cbr\u003e Major Penalty Proceedings: \u003cbr\u003e Initiation: Disciplinary proceedings are instituted when a charge sheet is issued. The DA prepares definite and distinct articles of charge and a statement of allegations. The charge sheet must include a list of documents and witnesses. \u003cbr\u003e Written Statement of Defence (WSOD): The officer must submit a reply to the charges within 15 days. If the officer admits all charges unconditionally, the DA can record findings and take appropriate evidence. \u003cbr\u003e Inquiry: If charges are not admitted, the DA may cause an inquiry to be made. The EO must send a notice to the officer to appear for a preliminary hearing. At the hearing, the EO confirms receipt of the charge sheet and asks the officer to plead guilty or not guilty. If the officer pleads not guilty or fails to appear, the EO asks the PO to produce evidence and adjourns the case. \u003cbr\u003e Evidence and Witnesses: The inquiry focuses on the facts, and the standard of proof is \"preponderance of probability,\" not \"proof beyond reasonable doubt\". The Indian Evidence Act and Criminal Procedure Code are not strictly applicable, but the principles of natural justice apply. The accused has the right to crossâ€examine witnesses. \u003cbr\u003e 111794Ex-parte Proceedings: An inquiry can be held exâ€parte if the accused employee fails to appear after being given a reasonable opportunity. However, exâ€parte proceedings are not allowed if the employee\u0027s inability to attend is due to nonâ€payment of subsistence allowance while under suspension. \u003cbr\u003e 111794 \u003cbr\u003e Inquiry Report: The EO must submit a report with objective, reasoned findings based on the evidence. The report must contain an introduction, the allegations, a summary of the case, and a conclusive finding on each charge. \u003cbr\u003e Action on Inquiry Reports and Penalties \u003cbr\u003e DA\u0027s Role: The DA is not bound by the EO\u0027s findings and can disagree with them, recording their reasons for doing so. If the DA disagrees with the findings, they must give the charged officer a notice and an opportunity to be heard before recording their own findings. \u003cbr\u003e Penalties: Penalties should be commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct. The document lists both minor and major penalties for officers and employees. \u003cbr\u003e Minor Penalties (Officers): Censure, withholding increments without cumulative effect, recovery of pecuniary loss, and reduction to a lower pay stage for up to two years without cumulative effect. \u003cbr\u003e Major Penalties (Officers): Reduction to a lower pay stage with cumulative effect, reduction to a lower grade or post, compulsory retirement, removal from service, and dismissal. \u003cbr\u003e Certain actions, like withholding increments for failing a departmental test or not promoting a person found unsuitable, are not considered penalties. \u003cbr\u003e Disciplinary Proceedings after Retirement: Proceedings can continue against a retired employee who was under suspension or against whom proceedings were initiated before retirement. However, the employee is not entitled to pay, allowances, or retirement benefits (other than their own Provident Fund contribution) after the date of superannuation until the proceedings are concluded. \u003cbr\u003e Suspension: An officer or employee may be suspended by the Competent Authority. The subsistence allowance for officers is oneâ€third of their basic pay for the first three months, then \u003cbr\u003e half their basic pay for departmental inquiries. For employees, the allowance may increase to full pay after one year if the delay is not attributable to them. \u003cbr\u003e Appeal: An officer or employee can appeal an order to the Appellate Authority within 45 days. The appeal must be in writing, respectful, and complete.

Triggers and thresholds determine when process notes, explanations and formal examinations are required; routine accountability is generally avoided for small exposures (e.g., â‰¤ Rs.1 lakh) unless fraud or gross negligence is involved. Timelines mandate prompt process notes (within 7 days of slippage), a 3-month cooling period, and completion of examinations/investigations within 6 months of NPA classification, while frauds and criminal matters are accelerated and exempt from some time limits. Investigations are led by independent Investigating Officers, vetted by tiered Staff Accountability Examination Committees, and routed through vigilance and disciplinary channels for action, with safeguards for past performance, causal linkage to losses, supervisory responsibilities, and limited retrospective scrutiny (normally up to 4 years), and centralized monitoring by a nodal office to ensure consistency and record-keeping. \u003cbr\u003e For more details refer Circular no.13 dt.01.05.2025 \u003cbr\u003e Uttar Pradesh Gramin Bank Initiatives in 2025-26 â€“ \u003cbr\u003e September 2025 -Special campaign for increasing Retail Loan Balance â€œNavratri \u003cbr\u003e Special Festival Campaignâ€.

This right does not confer the right of sale of such goods and securities. \u003cbr\u003e Particular Lien: \u003cbr\u003e A \u0027particular lien\u0027 gives the right to retain possession only of those goods in respect of which the dues have arisen, e.g. a tailor retaining the possession of a suit he has stitched for a customer until the stitching charges are paid. \u003cbr\u003e General Lien \u003cbr\u003e A \u0027general lien\u0027 gives the right to retain possession of any goods in the legal possession of the creditor until the whole of the debt due from the debtor is paid. \u003cbr\u003e Banker has a right of general lien against his borrower. Sec.171 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 confers the right of general lien on the bankers as under â€“ \u003cbr\u003e Banker can retain as a security for a general balance of account, any goods bailed to them. \u003cbr\u003e It is available unless there is any explicit contract to the contrary. \u003cbr\u003e The \u0027Right of Sale\u0027 of goods under lien is also available to the banker. It is, therefore, said that banker\u0027s lien is tantamount to an \u0027Implied Pledge\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e Banker\u0027s right of lien is not barred by the Law of Limitation. \u003cbr\u003e If the bank has obtained a particular security for a particular debt only, then the banker\u0027s right gets converted into a particular lien. \u003cbr\u003e Where right of lien can be exercised: \u003cbr\u003e On all the goods and securities entrusted legally in the capacity as banker. \u003cbr\u003e On goods and securities standing in the name of the borrower. \u003cbr\u003e On the securities remaining in the possession of the banker even after the loan taken against them has been paid, for the dues of the same borrower. \u003cbr\u003e If the securities offered by the customer for a personal loan are given to the banker in the capacity of a \u0027trustee\u0027, right of lien can be exercised. \u003cbr\u003e Cheques deposited by a customer for collection can be subject to banker\u0027s lien. \u003cbr\u003e Only goods and securities are subject to banker\u0027s lien.

Meanwhile, the customer has issued a cheque favouring Mr.X for ` .5,000/- which is returned unpaid due to set-off. The customer may sue the bank for \u0027wrongful dishonour\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e The customer has no corresponding right of set-off to combine his several accounts for the purpose of withdrawal e.g. customer has two accounts with a branch. He has drawn a cheque for \u003cbr\u003e ` .5,000/- in the first account. There is insufficient balance in the account to pay the cheque but there is sufficient balance to pay the same in the second account. Customer cannot assume that bank will pay the cheque adjusting the balance in the second account. \u003cbr\u003e Where right of set-off is applicable: \u003cbr\u003e Against customer\u0027s two or more accounts provided both/all the accounts are in the same name and same right of the customer. \u003cbr\u003e Two or more accounts though with different title but belonging to one person, right of set- off can be applied. For example customer\u0027s personal savings bank account and customer\u0027s loan account of a proprietorship firm in which the customer is the proprietor. \u003cbr\u003e It can be applied to recover the firm\u0027s debts from partner\u0027s individual account, provided the partners are jointly and severally liable. In case of joint accounts also this is applicable. \u003cbr\u003e It can be exercised even if two accounts are in different branches. \u003cbr\u003e It is applicable only in debts which are due and becoming due. It is not applicable on future debts. \u003cbr\u003e It is available in case of time barred debts also. \u003cbr\u003e 111794In case of insolvency of a person or liquidation of a company all future debts/contingent liabilities become due immediately.

Secs. 59, 60 and 61 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 deal with appropriation of payments: \u003cbr\u003e Sec.59: Where a debtor, owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a payment to him, either with express intimation, or under circumstances, implying that the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt, the payment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly. \u003cbr\u003e Sec.60: Where the debtor has omitted to intimate, and there are no other circumstances indicating to which debt, the payment is to be applied, the creditor may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt, actually due and payable to him from the debtor, whether its recovery is or is not barred by the law of limitation of suits. \u003cbr\u003e Sec.61: Where neither party makes any appropriation, the payment shall be applied in discharge of debts, in order of time, whether they are or not barred by the limitation of suits. If the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied in discharge of each proportionately. \u003cbr\u003e Claytonâ€™s Rule: In case of running accounts like current account or cash credit accounts, normally there is no specific appropriation of funds to exact debit. In such cases it is the first item on the debit \u003cbr\u003e side that is discharged or reduced by the first item on the credit side. This principle was originally formulated in Devaynes v. Noble known as Claytonâ€™s Case. The same clause is incorporated in Section 61 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. \u003cbr\u003e Thus this rule is applicable mainly in case of overdraft \u0026 cash-credit account of other than sole proprietor firm and as per this rule the credit entry will set-off the debit entry, in chronological order \u003cbr\u003e This rule is applicable in case of \u003cbr\u003e Death or insolvency or insanity of a borrower or joint borrower \u003cbr\u003e A death, insolvency, insanity retirement of partner in a firm or death \u003cbr\u003e Banker\u0027s right to charge interest, commission, incidental charges etc.: \u003cbr\u003e Banker has the right to charge interest on amount advanced by the bank, charge commission, exchange, incidental charges etc. for services rendered and sold to a customer. \u003cbr\u003e 111794It is an implied term of any loan agreement that the bank may debit customer\u0027s account with the amount of interest.
